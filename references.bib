  abstract = {Marine biota are redistributing at a rapid pace in response to climate change and shifting seascapes. While changes in fish populations and community structure threaten the sustainability of fisheries, our capacity to adapt by tracking and projecting marine species remains a challenge due to data discontinuities in biological observations, lack of data availability, and mismatch between data and real species distributions. To assess the extent of this challenge, we review the global status and accessibility of ongoing scientific bottom trawl surveys. In total, we gathered metadata for 283,925 samples from 95 surveys conducted regularly from 2001 to 2019. We identified that 59\% of the metadata collected are not publicly available, highlighting that the availability of data is the most important challenge to assess species redistributions under global climate change. Given that the primary purpose of surveys is to provide independent data to inform stock assessment of commercially important populations, we further highlight that single surveys do not cover the full range of the main commercial demersal fish species. An average of 18 surveys is needed to cover at least 50\% of species ranges, demonstrating the importance of combining multiple surveys to evaluate species range shifts. We assess the potential for combining surveys to track transboundary species redistributions and show that differences in sampling schemes and inconsistency in sampling can be overcome with spatio-temporal modeling to follow species density redistributions. In light of our global assessment, we establish a framework for improving the management and conservation of transboundary and migrating marine demersal species. We provide directions to improve data availability and encourage countries to share survey data, to assess species vulnerabilities, and to support management adaptation in a time of climate-driven ocean changes.},

  abstract = {The relationships between a predator population's mortality rate and its population size and stability are investigated for several simple predator-prey models with stage-structured prey populations. Several alternative models are considered; these differ in their assumptions about the nature of density dependence in the prey's population growth; the nature of stage-transitions; and the stage-selectivity of the predator. Instability occurs at high, rather than low predator mortality rates in most models with highly stage-selective predation; this is the opposite of the effect of mortality on stability in models with homogeneous prey populations. Stage-selective predation also increases the range of parameters that lead to a stable equilibrium. The results suggest that it may be common for a stable predator population to increase in abundance as its own mortality rate increases in stable systems, provided that the predator has a saturating functional response. Sufficiently strong density dependence in the prey generally reverses this outcome, and results in a decrease in predator population size with increasing predator mortality rate. Stability is decreased when the juvenile stage has a fixed duration, but population increases with increasing mortality are still observed in large areas of stable parameter space. This raises two coupled questions which are as yet unanswered; (1) do such increases in population size with higher mortality actually occur in nature; and (2) if not, what prevents them from occurring? Stage-structured prey and stage-related predation can also reverse the 'paradox of enrichment', leading to stability rather than instability when prey growth is increased. \textcopyright{} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

This article reviews and unifies previous work on this phenomenon. Some discrete models of density-dependent growth were shown to exhibit hydra effects in 1954, but the topic was then ignored for decades. Here the history of research on the hydra effect is reviewed, and the key factors producing it are explored. Mortality that precedes overcompensatory density dependence always has the potential to produce hydra effects. Even when mortality follows density dependence, hydra effects may occur in unstable systems due to changes in the amplitude and{$\fracslash$} or form of population cycles. An increase in resource productivity due to lower consumption rates following increased consumer mortality can also produce a hydra effect. Lower consumption can come about as the result of increased satiation of the consumers or changes in behaviour of either consumer or resource species that reduce the mean attack rate. Changes in species composition of a resource community may also decrease the average attack rate. Population structure can promote hydra effects by allowing separation of the timing of density dependence and mortality, although stage-specific density dependence usually decreases hydra effects.},

RESULTS: The biological significance of the straight-line plots obtained over wide ranges of species when B is plotted against log M remains a matter of debate. In this article we review the values ascribed to the gradients of such graphs (typically 0.75, according to the majority view), and we assess various attempts to explain the allometric power-law phenomenon, placing emphasis on the most recent publications. CONCLUSION: Although many of the models that have been advanced have significant attractions, none can be accepted without serious reservations, and the possibility that no one model can fit all cases has to be more seriously entertained.},

  abstract = {Many current issues in ecology require predictions made by mathematical models, which are built on somewhat arbitrary choices. Their consequences are quantified by sensitivity analysis to quantify how changes in model parameters propagate into an uncertainty in model predictions. An extension called structural sensitivity analysis deals with changes in the mathematical description of complex processes like predation. Such processes are described at the population scale by a specific mathematical function taken among similar ones, a choice that can strongly drive model predictions. However, it has only been studied in simple theoretical models. Here, we ask whether structural sensitivity is a problem of oversimplified models. We found in predator\textendash prey models describing chemostat experiments that these models are less structurally sensitive to the choice of a specific functional response if they include mass balance resource dynamics and individual maintenance. Neglecting these processes in an ecological model (for instance by using the well-known logistic growth equation) is not only an inappropriate description of the ecological system, but also a source of more uncertain predictions.},

Modelled bottom types were compared to observations and the results showed that the model successfully managed to capture the horizontal, as well as the vertical, distribution of the different bottom types: accumulation, transport and erosion bottoms. The model also captured well the nutrient element contents in the sediments. On average the largest contribution of resuspended organic carbon to the transport of total organic carbon is found at erosion and transport bottoms. Although the relative transport of resuspended organic carbon at deeper accumulation bottoms in general is low ({$<$}10\% of total), the central parts of the sub-basins act on average as sinks that import organic matter while the more shallow areas and the coastal regions acts as sources of organic carbon in the water column. This indicates that the particulate organic matter produced in erosion and transport areas might be kept in suspension long enough to be transported and settle in less energetic areas, i.e. on accumulation bottoms.},

We analyzed the severity of climate change predicted for existing dead zones, and found that 94\% of dead zones are in regions that will experience at least a 2 \textdegree C temperature increase by the end of the century. We then reviewed how climate change will exacerbate hypoxic conditions through oceanographic, ecological, and physiological processes. We found evidence that suggests numerous climate variables including temperature, ocean acidification, sea-level rise, precipitation, wind, and storm patterns will affect dead zones, and that each of those factors has the potential to act through multiple pathways on both oxygen availability and ecological responses to hypoxia. Given the variety and strength of the mechanisms by which climate change exacerbates hypoxia, and the rates at which climate is changing, we posit that climate change variables are contributing to the dead zone epidemic by acting synergistically with one another and with recognized anthropogenic triggers of hypoxia including eutrophication. This suggests that a multidisciplinary, integrated approach that considers the full range of climate variables is needed to track and potentially reverse the spread of dead zones.},

  abstract = {Understanding how temperature variation influences the negative (e.g. self-limitation) and positive (e.g. saturating functional responses) feedback processes that characterize consumer-resource interactions is an important research priority. Previous work on this topic has yielded conflicting outcomes with some studies predicting that warming should increase consumer-resource oscillations and others predicting that warming should decrease consumer-resource oscillations. Here, I develop a consumer-resource model that both synthesizes previous findings in a common framework and yields novel insights about temperature effects on consumer-resource dynamics. I report three key findings. First, when the resource species' birth rate exhibits a unimodal temperature response, as demonstrated by a large number of empirical studies, the temperature range over which the consumer-resource interaction can persist is determined by the lower and upper temperature limits to the resource species' reproduction. This contrasts with the predictions of previous studies, which assume that the birth rate exhibits a monotonic temperature response, that consumer extinction is determined by temperature effects on consumer species' traits, rather than the resource species' traits. Secondly, the comparative analysis I have conducted shows that whether warming leads to an increase or decrease in consumer-resource oscillations depends on the manner in which temperature affects intraspecific competition. When the strength of self-limitation increases monotonically with temperature, warming causes a decrease in consumer-resource oscillations. However, if self-limitation is strongest at temperatures physiologically optimal for reproduction, a scenario previously unanalysed by theory but amply substantiated by empirical data, warming can cause an increase in consumer-resource oscillations. Thirdly, the model yields testable comparative predictions about consumer-resource dynamics under alternative hypotheses for how temperature affects competitive and resource acquisition traits. Importantly, it does so through empirically quantifiable metrics for predicting temperature effects on consumer viability and consumer-resource oscillations, which obviates the need for parameterizing complex dynamical models. Tests of these metrics with empirical data on a host-parasitoid interaction yield realistic estimates of temperature limits for consumer persistence and the propensity for consumer-resource oscillations, highlighting their utility in predicting temperature effects, particularly warming, on consumer-resource interactions in both natural and agricultural settings.},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor. Online enhancements: appendixes. abstract: Understanding how temperature influences population regulation through its effects on intraspecific competition is an im-portant question for which there is currently little theory or data. Here we develop a theoretical framework for elucidating temperature effects on competition that integrates mechanistic descriptions of life-history trait responses to temperature with population models that realistically capture the variable developmental delays that char-acterize ectotherm life cycles. This framework yields testable com-parative predictions about how intraspecific competition affects re-production, development, and mortality under alternative hypotheses about the temperature dependence of competition. The key finding is that ectotherm population regulation in seasonal environments depends crucially on the mechanisms by which temperature affects competition. When competition is strongest at temperatures optimal for reproduction, effects of temperature and competition act antag-onistically, leading to more complex dynamics than when compe-tition is temperature independent. When the strength of competition increases with temperature past the optimal temperature for repro-duction, effects of temperature and competition act synergistically, leading to dynamics qualitatively similar to those when competition is temperature independent. Paradoxically, antagonistic effects yield a higher population floor despite greater fluctuations. These findings have important implications for predicting effects of climate warming on population regulation. Synergistic effects of temperature and com-petition can predispose populations to stochastic extinction by low-ering minimum population sizes, while antagonistic effects can in-crease the potential for population outbreaks through greater fluctuations in abundance.},

We hypothesize, on the basis of Jensen's inequality, that this pattern is driven by latitudinal variation in seasonal temperature fluctuations.We test this hypothesis with an eco-evolutionary model that integrates the quantitative genetics of reaction norm evolution with stage-structured population dynamics, which we parameterize with data from insects. We find that thermal optima of temperate and Mediterranean species evolve to exceed the mean habitat tem- perature if seasonal fluctuations are strong, while the thermal optimum of tropical species evolves to coincide with the mean habitat temperature if fluctuations are weak. Importantly, ecological dynam- ics can impose a constraint on reaction normevolution. Tropical species cannot tolerate an increase in seasonal fluctuations at the high mean habitat temperature it experiences, while the temperate species cannot tolerate a reduction in seasonal fluctuations if the mean temperature is higher. In both cases, stochastic extinction during periods of low abundances precludes adaptation to a novel thermal environment. Our findings suggest a potential directionality in colonization success. Tropical ectotherms, because of their high thermal optima, can successfully colonize temperate habitats, while temperate ectotherms, because of their low optima, are less successful in colonizing tropical habitats.},

We derive the abundance of species as a function of their asymptotic size. The derivation is based on size-spectrum theory, where population structure is derived from physiology and simple arguments regarding the predator-prey interaction. Using a hypothesis of constant satiation, which states that the average degree of satiation is independent of the size of an organism, the number of individuals with a given size is found to be proportional to the weight raised to the power Ϫ2.05, independent of the predator/prey size ratio. This is the first time the spectrum exponent has been derived solely on the basis of processes at the individual level. The theory furthermore predicts that the parameters in the von Bertalanffy growth function are related as K {$\propto$} LϪ{$\varrho$}1.},

The reaction of the ecosystem goes beyond the trophic levels directly targeted by the fishery. This reaction has been described either as a change in slope of the overall size spectrum or as a trophic cascade triggered by the removal of top predators. Here we use a novel size- and trait-based model to explore how marine ecosystems might react to perturbations from different types of fishing pressure. The model explicitly resolves the whole life history of fish, from larvae to adults. The results show that fishing does not change the overall slope of the size spectrum, but depletes the largest individuals and induces trophic cascades. A trophic cascade can propagate both up and down in trophic levels driven by a combination of changes in predation mortality and food limitation. The cascade is damped as it comes further away from the perturbed trophic level. Fishing on several trophic levels leads to a disappearance of the signature of the trophic cascade. Differences in fishing patterns among ecosystems might influence whether a trophic cascade is observed.},

Fish Ecology, Evolution, and Exploitation is an authoritative introduction to the modern size- and trait-based approach to fish populations and communities.Ken Andersen covers the theoretical foundations, mathematical formulations, and real-world applications of this powerful new modeling method, which is grounded in the latest ecological theory and population biology. He begins with fundamental assumptions on the level of individuals and goes on to cover population demography and fisheries impact assessments. He shows how size- and trait-based models shed new light on familiar fisheries concepts such as maximum sustainable yield and fisheries selectivity\textemdash insights that classic age-based theory can't provide\textemdash and develops novel evolutionary impacts of fishing. Andersen extends the theory to entire fish communities and uses it to support the ecosystem approach to fisheries management, and forges critical links between trait-based methods and evolutionary ecology.Accessible to ecologists with a basic quantitative background, this incisive book unifies the thinking in ecology and fisheries science and is an indispensable reference for anyone seeking to apply size- and trait-based models to fish demography, fisheries impact assessments, and fish evolutionary ecology.},

The effects on evacuation of photoperiod and pre-experimental treatment of prey were also tested. Freshly killed A. tobianus were evacuated from the stomach of G. morhua at a rate similar to the value estimated from conspecifics kept deep-frozen and subsequently thawed prior to the evacuation experiment. The evacuation rate in G. morhua exposed to continuous light did not differ from the rate obtained from fish maintained under a 12L:12D photoperiod. The evacuation rates estimated from the latter fish in the dark and light periods, respectively, were likewise similar. These results indicate that the resistance of prey to the digestive processes is not altered significantly by the pre-experimental treatment of prey and that there is no diurnal variation per se in the rate of evacuation for G. morhua. Therefore, it is believed that the present parameterization of the evacuation model should prove especially useful for studying the role of G. morhua as a top predator in natural systems.},

For `data-poor' stocks, vital rates may be estimated from empirical size-based relationships or from life-history invariants. However, a theoretical framework to synthesize these empirical relations is lacking. Here, we combine life-history invariants, metabolic scaling and size-spectrum theory to develop a general size- and trait-based theory for demography and recruitment of exploited fish stocks. Important concepts are physiological or metabolic scaled mortalities and flux of individuals or their biomass to size. The theory is based on classic metabolic relations at the individual level and uses asymptotic size W{$\infty$} as a trait. The theory predicts fundamental similarities and differences between small and large species in vital rates and response to fishing. The central result is that larger species have a higher egg production per recruit than small species. This means that density dependence is stronger for large than for small species and has the consequence that fisheries reference points that incorporate recruitment do not obey metabolic scaling rules. This result implies that even though small species have a higher productivity than large species their resilience towards fishing is lower than expected from metabolic scaling rules. Further, we show that the fishing mortality leading to maximum yield per recruit is an ill-suited reference point. The theory can be used to generalize the impact of fishing across species and for making demographic and evolutionary impact assessments of fishing, particularly in data-poor situations.},

However, current methods for joint inference about temporal and spatial dynamics (e.g., spatiotemporal modeling with Gaussian random fields) may perform poorly when underlying processes include extreme events. Here we introduce a model that allows for extremes to occur simultaneously in time and space. Our model is a Bayesian predictive-process GLMM (generalized linear mixed-effects model) that uses a multivariate-t distribution to describe spatial random effects. The approach is easily implemented with our flexible R package glmmfields. First, using simulated data, we demonstrate the ability to recapture spatiotemporal extremes, and explore the consequences of fitting models that ignore such extremes. Second, we predict tree mortality from mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) outbreaks in the U.S. Pacific Northwest over the last 16 yr. We show that our approach provides more accurate and precise predictions compared to traditional spatiotemporal models when extremes are present. Our R package makes these models accessible to a wide range of ecologists and scientists in other disciplines interested in fitting spatiotemporal GLMMs, with and without extremes.},

However, regulatory agencies often lack the capacity to translate those data into effective monitoring information. Here, we describe an approach of automated visualization of raw fisheries data and demonstrate it with a report on 113 groundfish species in Pacific Canadian waters. Our implementation consists of two pages per species that show standardized visualizations of temporal trends and spatial distributions of commercial catches and survey indices, along with analyses of age, size, maturity, and growth. The approach facilitates discussions on stock assessment and survey prioritization, increases transparency about data holdings, and makes data available for regular review by interested parties. We encourage other agencies to consider similar approaches for their own data.},

  abstract = {Geostatistical data---spatially referenced observations related to some continuous spatial phenomenon---are ubiquitous in ecology and can reveal ecological processes and inform management decisions. However, appropriate models to analyze these data, such as generalized linear mixed effects models (GLMMs) with Gaussian random fields, are often computationally intensive and challenging to implement, interpret, and evaluate. Here, we introduce the R package sdmTMB, which implements predictive-process SPDE- (stochastic partial differential equation) based spatial and spatiotemporal models. Estimation is conducted via maximum marginal likelihood with Template Model Builder (TMB) but can be extended to penalized likelihood or Bayesian inference. We describe the statistical model, illustrate the package's use through two case studies, and compare the functionality, speed, and interface to related software. We highlight advantages of using sdmTMB for this class of models: (1) sdmTMB provides a flexible interface familiar to users of glm(), lme4, glmmTMB, or mgcv; (2) estimation is often faster than alternatives; (3) sdmTMB provides simple out-of-sample cross validation; (4) non-stationary processes (time-varying and spatially varying coefficients) are easily constructed with a formula interface; and (5) sdmTMB includes features not available as a combination in related packages (e.g., penalized smoothers and break-point effects, anisotropy, abundance index standardization). We hope that sdmTMB's user-friendly interface will open this useful class of models to a wider audience within species distribution modelling and beyond.},

The overall mean B/LRP in 2020 was 3.2 (95\% credible interval [CI]: 2.6\textendash 3.9).

Average stock status declined from 1950 to around 2000 and has remained relatively stable since then. The change around 2000 followed the implementation of ITQs (individual transferable quotas) for the trawl fleet and the commencement of the synoptic trawl surveys. As of their last assessment, four stocks (Strait of Georgia Lingcod [Area 4B], coastwide Bocaccio, and inside and outside Quillback Rockfish) had a greater than 5\% probability of being below their LRP (i.e., in the `` critical zone''); Pacific Cod in Area 3CD had a 4.6\% probability. Roughly one-third of stocks had a greater than 1 in 4 chance of being below their USR (i.e., in the `` cautious zone'').

  abstract = {It is now clear that fished populations can fluctuate more than unharvested stocks. However, it is not clear why. Here we distinguish among three major competing mechanisms for this phenomenon, by using the 50-year California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) larval fish record. First, variable fishing pressure directly increases variability in exploited populations. Second, commercial fishing can decrease the average body size and age of a stock, causing the truncated population to track environmental fluctuations directly. Third, age-truncated or juvenescent populations have increasingly unstable population dynamics because of changing demographic parameters such as intrinsic growth rates. We find no evidence for the first hypothesis, limited evidence for the second and strong evidence for the third. Therefore, in California Current fisheries, increased temporal variability in the population does not arise from variable exploitation, nor does it reflect direct environmental tracking. More fundamentally, it arises from increased instability in dynamics. This finding has implications for resource management as an empirical example of how selective harvesting can alter the basic dynamics of exploited populations, and lead to unstable booms and busts that can precede systematic declines in stock levels.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In marine fish species, where pelagic egg and larvae drift with ocean currents, population structure has been suggested to be maintained by larval retention due to hydrographic structuring and by homing of adult fish to natal areas. Whilst natal homing of adults has been demonstrated for anadromous and coral reef fishes, there are few documented examples of philopatric migration in temperate marine fish species. RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate temporally stable genetic differentiation among spawning populations of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.), and present genetic and behavioural evidence for larval drift and philopatric migration in the eastern North Sea-Skagerrak-Kattegat area. We show that juvenile cod collected in the eastern Skagerrak and central Kattegat are genetically similar to cod from offshore spawning areas in the eastern North Sea. Genetic assignment of individual 2-5 year old fish indicates that cod residing at, or migrating towards, spawning areas in Kattegat and the North Sea display philopatric behaviours. CONCLUSIONS: Together these findings suggest a loop between spawning, larval drift and adult return-migrations to spawning areas and underlines that both oceanographic processes and migratory behaviour in the adult phase may be important for stock separation and integrity in marine temperate fishes such as Atlantic cod.},

I analyze previously published data to demonstrate how one applies this approach to describe a thermal performance curve. This exemplary analysis produced two interesting results. First, a model with a very high r2 (a modified Gaussian function) appeared to overfit the data. Second, the model favored by information theory (a Gaussian function) has been used widely in optimality studies of thermal performance curves. Finally, I discuss the choice between regression and ANOVA when comparing thermal performance curves and highlight a superior method called template mode of variation. Much progress can be made by abandoning traditional methods for a method that combines information theory with template mode of variation.},

This widespread pattern is embodied by two well-established rules: Bergmann's rule, which describes the association between temperature and body size in natural environments, and the temperature-size rule, which describes reaction norms relating temperature to body size in laboratory experiments. Theory predicts that organisms should grow to be larger in colder environments when growth efficiency decreases with increasing environmental temperature. Using data from 97 laboratory experiments, including 58 species of ectotherms, we found little evidence that growth efficiency is negatively related to environmental temperature within the thermal range that is relevant to the temperature-size rule. Instead, growth efficiency was either positively related or insensitive to environmental temperature in the majority of cases (73 of 89 cases for gross growth efficiency and 18 of 24 cases for net growth efficiency). Two possibilities merit consideration. First, high temperatures may impose constraints on growth that only arise late during ontogeny; this simple and potentially general explanation is supported by the fact that thermal optima for growth efficiency and growth rate decrease as individuals grow. Alternatively, the general explanation for relationships between temperature and body size may not be simple. If the latter view is correct, the best approach might be to generate and test theories that are tailored specifically to organisms with similar behavior and physiology.},

Here, we briefly discuss this theoretical debate and then summarize empirical studies that address whether hotter is better. In general, comparative and experimental studies support the view that hotter is better. Furthermore, recent modeling has shown that thermodynamic constraints impose unique selective pressures on thermal sensitivity. Nevertheless, the thermodynamic effect on maximal performance varies greatly among traits and taxa, suggesting the need to develop a more sophisticated view of thermodynamic constraints.},

Here, we relate trends in species richness and abundance from 21,500\,terrestrial and marine assemblage time series across temperate regions (23.5-60.0\textdegree{} latitude) to changes in air or sea surface temperature. We find a strong coupling between biodiversity and temperature changes in the marine realm, where species richness mostly increases with warming. However, biodiversity responses are conditional on the baseline climate, such that in initially warmer locations richness increase is more pronounced while abundance declines with warming. In contrast, we do not detect systematic temperature-related richness or abundance trends on land, despite a greater magnitude of warming. As the world is committed to further warming, substantial challenges remain in maintaining local biodiversity amongst the non-uniform inflow and outflow of 'climate migrants'. Temperature-driven community restructuring is especially evident in the ocean, whereas climatic debt may be accumulating on land.},

At each temperature there were linear relationships between logarithms of (a) specific growth rate (G\%/day) and body weight (Wg), and (b) feed conversion ratio (FCR) and W. The slopes of the regressions were linearly related to temperature and the intercepts of the regression changed with temperature according to a second order polynomial. The optimal temperature for growth (Topt.G) is predicted to decline with increasing body weight: Topt.G = 22.45 - 0.713lnW, i.e. 22.5, 20.8, 19.1 and 17.5 \textdegree C for 1, 10, 100 and 1000 g fish, respectively, and the growth rates of these fish sizes at their optimal temperature (Gmax) were predicted to be 7.63, 2.73, 1.03 and 0.40\%/day, respectively. The optimal temperature for feed conversion (Topt.FCR) is also predicted to decline with increasing fish size: Topt.FCR = 18.80 - 0.625lnW, i.e. 18.8, 17.4, 15.9 and 14.5 \textdegree C for 1, 10, 100 and 1000 g fish, respectively, and the predicted feed conversions of these fish sizes (FCRmin) were 0.44, 0.56, 0.68 and 0.82 for the present feed types.

  abstract = {We studied fish size structure by using mean size, size diversity, and the slope of linear size spectra of six common European fish species along large-scale environmental gradients. We further analyzed the response of these three size metrics to environmental variables and to density-dependent effects, i.e., relative estimates of abundance (catch per unit effort, CPUE). We found differences in the strength of main predictors of size structure between the six species, but the direction of the response was relatively similar and consistent for most of the size metrics. Mean body size was negatively related to temperature for perch (Perca fluviatilis), roach (Rutilus rutilus), and ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernuus). Lake productivity (expressed as total phos- phorus concentration) and lake depth were also predictors of size structure for four of six species. Moreover, we found a strong density dependence of size structure for all species, resulting in lower mean body size and size diversity and steeper size spectra slopes when density dependence increases. This suggests that density dependence is a key driver of fish size structure.}

  abstract = {An inverse relationship between temperature during ontogeny and final body size is widespread in ectotherms, but poorly understood. Evidence suggests that within organs, this ``temperature-size rule'' (TSR) may also apply to cell size with no change in numbers. So how closely do reductions in size and number of cells and other repeated structures correlate with size reduction at higher levels of organization? We examine this in the context of a proposal that size and/or number changes at various organizational levels are adaptive responses to temperature- and size-dependent oxygen supply. We subjected two clones of the modular colonial bryozoan, Celleporella hyalina, to orthogonal combinations of two temperatures and two oxygen concentrations during ontogeny, observing effects on sizes of colonies and larvae, and sizes and numbers of cells, tentacles, and modules (autozooids). We found that the size:number responses varied among cell types and among structures at different levels of organization, with the inverse temperature-size relationship applying only to larval parenchymal cells and colony modules. Using our findings and other evidence we propose a unifying adaptive hypothesis that predicts how temperature affects the sizes of mitochondria, cells, organs, modules and organisms, and their relationships with processes that determine the functional capacity of aerobic metabolism.},

  abstract = {IntroductionAn organism's life history is its lifetime pattern of growth, differentiation, storage of reserves and reproduction (Begon et al., 1990: 473). Life-history traits therefore include size at birth and maturity and the investment in reproduction at different ages and sizes (Roff, 1992; Stearns, 1992).The temperatures under which ectothermic organisms evolve can sometimes have the same qualitative effects on life-history traits as temperatures experienced during development. The evolutionary effect comprises differences between genotypes arising from selection for several generations at different temperatures, and are observed when the different genetic lines are then reared under identical environmental conditions. By contrast, the developmental effect is the result of phenotypic plasticity and can even be observed among members of a clone reared at different temperatures. An example of such similar responses is the common decrease in adult size in Drosophila following evolution or development at increased temperatures (pp. 265\textendash 92; Partridge et al., 1994). Whether this similarity arises because the same selection pressures cause evolution of both size and the developmental response (or reaction norm; Stearns, 1992) of size to different temperatures, is not known. Developmental responses of body size to temperature are reviewed and discussed in the present chapter, while both developmental and evolutionary responses are discussed by Partridge \&amp; French (pp. 265\textendash 92) with special reference to studies on Drosophila.},

  abstract = {Humans are changing marine ecosystems worldwide, both directly through fishing and indirectly through climate change. One of the little explored outcomes of human-induced change involves the decreasing body sizes of fishes. We use a marine ecosystem model to explore how a slow (less than 0.1\% per year) decrease in the length of five harvested species could affect species interactions, biomasses and yields. We find that even small decreases in fish sizes are amplified by positive feedback loops in the ecosystem and can lead to major changes in natural mortality. For some species, a total of 4 per cent decrease in length-at-age over 50 years resulted in 50 per cent increase in predation mortality. However, the magnitude and direction in predation mortality changes differed among species and one shrinking species even experienced reduced predation pressure. Nevertheless, 50 years of gradual decrease in body size resulted in 1\textendash 35\% decrease in biomasses and catches of all shrinking species. Therefore, fisheries management practices that ignore contemporary life-history changes are likely to overestimate long-term yields and can lead to overfishing.}

While age-specific mortality is considered to be the main determinant of the optimal allocation, some life-history strategies, such as delayed or skipped reproduction, may be better understood when also accounting for reproduction costs. Here, we present a two-pool indeterminate grower model that includes survival and energetic costs of reproduction. The energetic cost sets a minimum reserve required for reproduction, while the survival cost reflects increased mortality from low postreproductive body condition. Three life-history parameters determining age-dependent energy allocation to soma, reserve, and reproduction are optimized, and we show that the optimal strategies can reproduce realistic emergent growth trajectories, maturation ages, and reproductive outputs for fish. The model predicts maturation phase shifts along the gradient of condition-related mortality and shows that increased harvesting will select for earlier maturation and higher energy allocation to reproduction. However, since the energetic reproduction cost sets limits on how early an individual can mature, an increase in fitness at high harvesting can only be achieved by diverting most reserves into reproduction. The model presented here can improve predictions of life-history responses to environmental change and human impacts because key life-history traits such as maturation age and size, maximum body size, and size-specific fecundity emerge dynamically.},

  abstract = {The temperature-size rule is one of the universal rules in ecology and states that ectotherms in warmer waters will grow faster as juveniles, mature at smaller sizes and younger ages, and reach smaller maximum body sizes. Many models have unsuccessfully attempted to reproduce temperature-size rule-consistent life histories by using two-term (anabolism and catabolism) P\"utter-type growth models, such as the von Bertalanffy. Here, we present a physiologically structured individual growth model, which incorporates an energy budget and optimizes energy allocation to growth, reproduction, and reserves. Growth, maturation, and reproductive output emerge as a result of life-history optimization to specific physiological rates and mortality conditions. To assess which processes can lead to temperature-size rule-type life histories, we simulate 42 scenarios that differ in temperature and body size dependencies of intake, metabolism, and mortality rates. Results show that the temperature-size rule can emerge in two ways. The first way requires both intake and metabolism to increase with temperature, but the temperature-body size interaction of the two rates must lead to relatively faster intake increase in small individuals and relatively larger metabolism increase in large ones. The second way requires only higher temperature-driven natural mortality and faster intake rates in early life (no change in metabolic rates is needed). This selects for faster life histories with earlier maturation and increased reproductive output. Our model provides a novel mechanistic and evolutionary framework for identifying the conditions necessary for the temperature-size rule. It shows that the temperature-size rule is likely to reflect both physiological changes and life-history optimization and that use of von Bertalanffy-type models, which do not include reproduction processes, can hinder our ability to understand and predict ectotherm responses to climate change.},

  abstract = {Aim The negative correlation between temperature and body size of ectothermic animals (broadly known as the temperature-size rule or TSR) is a widely observed pattern, especially in aquatic organisms. Studies have claimed that the TSR arises due to decreased oxygen solubility and increasing metabolic costs at warmer temperatures, whereby oxygen supply to a large body becomes increasingly difficult. However, mixed empirical evidence has led to a controversy about the mechanisms affecting species' size and performance under different temperatures. We review the main competing genetic, physiological and ecological explanations for the TSR and suggest a roadmap to move the field forward. Location Global. Taxa Aquatic ectotherms. Time period 1980\textendash present. Results We show that current studies cannot discriminate among alternative hypotheses and none of the hypotheses can explain all TSR-related observations. To resolve this impasse, we need experiments and field-sampling programmes that specifically compare alternative mechanisms and formally consider energetics related to growth costs, oxygen supply and behaviour. We highlight the distinction between evolutionary and plastic mechanisms, and suggest that the oxygen limitation debate should separate processes operating on short, decadal and millennial time-scales. Conclusions Despite decades of research, we remain uncertain whether the TSR is an adaptive response to temperature-related physiological (enzyme activity) or ecological changes (food, predation and other mortality), or a response to constraints operating at a cellular level (oxygen supply and associated costs). To make progress, ecologists, physiologists, modellers and geneticists should work together to develop a cross-disciplinary research programme that integrates theory and data, explores time-scales over which the TSR operates, and assesses limits to adaptation or plasticity. We identify four questions for such a programme. Answering these questions is crucial given the widespread impacts of climate change and reliance of management on models that are highly dependent on accurate representation of ecological and physiological responses to temperature.},

  abstract = {Evidence is accumulating that many marine ectotherms are undergoing rapid changes in their life-history characteristics. These changes have been variously attributed to fisheries-induced evolution, inhibited adult growth rate due to oxygen limitation at higher temperatures, and plastic responses to density dependence or changes in ocean productivity. Here, we review the diverse underlying mechanisms by which plastic and evolutionary responses to climate change and fisheries are likely to produce similar life-history trends in harvested marine ectotherms, leading to faster life-histories with earlier maturation and smaller adult size-at-age. While mechanistically understanding these growth and maturation changes may be difficult, it is becoming clear that changing life-histories will lead to modified population dynamics, productivity and natural mortality of the affected species. We discuss how the observed and expected life-history changes could affect the assumptions and uncertainty within single and multispecies models currently used in marine ecosystem management, highlighting that models which allow for dynamic life-history traits often report significantly different estimates of stock biomass. Given that both climate- and harvest-induced life-history changes are likely to intensify and possibly amplify each other, there is an urgent need to adequately assess the implications of faster life-histories for marine ecosystem management. This is especially true for data-poor stocks, where growth and maturation are not regularly assessed. Targeted monitoring can be used to inform responsive management, but for improved sustainability outcomes, a precautionary approach to management that is robust to life-history trends is advised.},

However, in some applications there are boundaries, holes, or physical barriers in the study area, e.g. a coastline, and stationary models will inappropriately smooth over these features, requiring the use of a non-stationary model. We propose a new model, the Barrier model, which is different from the established methods as it is not based on the shortest distance around the physical barrier, nor on boundary conditions. The Barrier model is based on viewing the Mat\textbackslash 'ern correlation, not as a correlation function on the shortest distance between two points, but as a collection of paths through a Simultaneous Autoregressive (SAR) model. We then manipulate these local dependencies to cut off paths that are crossing the physical barriers. To make the new SAR well behaved, we formulate it as a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) that can be discretised to represent the Gaussian field, with a sparse precision matrix that is automatically positive definite. The main advantage with the Barrier model is that the computational cost is the same as for the stationary model. The model is easy to use, and can deal with both sparse data and very complex barriers, as shown in an application in the Finnish Archipelago Sea. Additionally, the Barrier model is better at reconstructing the modified Horseshoe test function than the standard models used in R-INLA.},

Location Tropical reefs around the globe, including 485 sites in 109 sub-provinces spread across 14 biogeographic provinces. Time period Present. Major taxa studied 2,523 species of reef fish. Methods We compiled a database encompassing 13,050 visual transects. We used hierarchical linear Bayesian models to investigate whether fish body size, reef area, isolation, temperature, and anthropogenic impacts correlate with reef-fish species richness at each spatial scale (i.e., sites, sub-provinces, provinces). Richness was estimated using coverage-based rarefaction. We also tested whether species packing (i.e., transect-level species richness/m2) is correlated with province-level richness. Results Body size had the strongest effect on species richness across all three spatial scales. Reef area and temperature were both positively correlated with richness at all spatial scales. At the site scale only, richness decreased with reef isolation. Species richness was not correlated with proxies of human impacts. Species packing was correlated with species richness at the province level following a sub-linear power function. Province-level differences in species richness were also mirrored by patterns of body size distribution at the site scale. Species-rich provinces exhibited heterogeneous assemblages of small-bodied species with small range sizes, whereas species-poor provinces encompassed homogeneous assemblages composed by larger species with greater dispersal capacity. Main conclusions Our findings suggest that body size distribution, reef area and temperature are major predictors of species richness and accumulation across scales, consistent with recent theories linking home range to species\textendash area relationships as well as metabolic effects on speciation rates. Based on our results, we hypothesize that in less diverse areas, species are larger and likely more dispersive, leading to larger range sizes and less turnover between sites. Our results indicate that changes in province-level (i.e., regional) richness should leave a tractable fingerprint in local assemblages, and that detailed studies on local-scale assemblage composition may be informative of responses occurring at larger scales.},

Here we use a first-principles theoretical model to characterise the energetics of fish growth at distinct ontogenetic stages and in distinct thermal regimes. Empirically, we show that the mass scaling of growth rates follows that of metabolic rate, and is somewhat steeper at earlier ontogenetic stages. We also demonstrate that the cost of growth, Em, varies substantially among fishes, and that it may increase with temperature, trophic level and level of activity. Theoretically, we show that Em is a primary determinant of the efficiency of energy transfer across trophic levels, and that energy is transferred more efficiently between trophic levels if the prey are young and sedentary. Overall, our study demonstrates the importance of characterising the energetics of individual growth in order to understand constraints on the structure of food webs and ecosystems.},

Many conventional SDMs rely on spatially-explicit but time-invariant conditions to quantify species distributions and densities. We compared these status quo `static' models with more climate-informed 'dynamic' SDMs to assess whether the addition of time-varying processes would improve hindcast performance and/or forecast skill. Here, we present two groundfish case studies from the Bering Sea \textendash{} a high latitude system that has recently undergone considerable warming. We relied on conventional statistics (R2, \% deviance explained, UBRE or GCV) to evaluate hindcast performance for presence\textendash absence, numerical abundance and biomass of arrowtooth flounder Atheresthes stomias and walleye pollock Gadus chalcogrammus. We then used retrospective skill testing to evaluate near-term forecast skill. Retrospective skill testing enables direct comparisons between forecasts and observations through a process of fitting and forecasting nested submodels within a given time series. We found that the inclusion of time-varying covariates improved hindcasts. However, dynamic models either did not improve or decreased forecast skill relative to static SDMs. This is likely a result of rapidly changing temperatures within the ecosystem, which required models to predict species responses to environmental conditions that were outside the range of observed values. Until additional model development allows for fully dynamic predictions, static model forecasts (or persistence forecasts from dynamic models) may serve as reliable placeholders, especially when anomalous conditions are anticipated. Nonetheless, our findings demonstrate support for the use of retrospective skill testing rather than selecting forecast models a priori based on their ability to quantify species\textendash habitat associations in the past.},

  abstract = {A common goal in ecology and its applications is to better understand how species' distributions change over space and time, yet many conventional summary metrics (e.g. center of gravity) of distribution shifts may offer limited inference because such changes may not be spatially homogenous. We develop a modeling approach to estimate a spatially explicit temporal trend (i.e. local trend), alongside spatial (temporally constant) and spatiotemporal (time-varying) components, to compare inferred spatial shifts to those indicated by conventional metrics. This method is generalizable to many data types including presence\textendash absence data, count data and continuous data types such as density. To demonstrate the utility of this new approach, we focus on the application of this model to a community of well-studied marine fish species on the US west coast (19 species, representing a wide range of presence\textendash absence and densities). Results from conventional model selection indicate that the use of the model accounting for local trends is clearly justified for over 89\% of these species. In addition to making more parsimonious and accurate predictions, we illustrate how estimated spatial fields from the local trend model can be used to classify regions within the species range where change is relatively homogenous. Conventional summary metrics, such as center of gravity, can then be calculated on each such region or within previously defined biogeographic boundaries. We use this approach to illustrate that change is more nuanced than what is expressed via global metrics. Using arrowtooth flounder Atheresthes stomias as an example, the observed southward shift over time in the center of gravity is not reflective of a uniform shift in densities but local trends of decreasing density in the northern region and rapidly increasing density at the southern edge of the species' range. Thus, estimating local trends with spatiotemporal models improves interpretation of species distribution change.},

  abstract = {The life cycle of diadromous fishes such as salmonids involves natural mortality in a series of distinct life history stages, occurring sequentially in different habitats. Decades of research have emphasized mortality at the embryo, juvenile, and sub-adult stages but it is increasingly clear that some adults that survive and return to freshwater habitats die during the final homeward migration or after they reach the spawning grounds, prior to breeding. These are termed ``en route'' and ``prespawning'' mortality, respectively, and can threaten populations depleted by mortality at previous stages. In this study, we present evidence that the sockeye salmon, Oncorhynchus nerka, population that returns to the Lake Washington Basin, in Washington State, USA, is experiencing both forms of adult mortality. Counts of the salmon entering the basin on their return migration in June and July were compared to counts in the major spawning grounds in September through November for 1995\textendash 2018. The disparity has increased markedly in recent years. The counts on the spawning grounds have decreased as a proportion of the number entering the system with an average 49 \% of sockeye unaccounted for, consistent with increased en route mortality. In addition, prespawning mortality rates have increased in salmon that reach the Cedar River, the main spawning tributary, both at a hatchery holding adult fish in 1995\textendash 2018, and in the naturally spawning populations when monitored in the last five years. Hatchery records indicated {$<$}10 \% prespawning mortality for 1995\textendash 2010, increasing to an average 43 \% for 2014 \textendash{} 2018. Recent carcass surveys in the Cedar River documented that 33.6\% (2014), 22.3\% (2015), 30.3\% (2016) and 50.0\% (2018) of female sockeye died before completing spawning. These recent increases in prespawning mortality have been associated with warm water during entry to freshwater, but comparably warm water in past decades had no such effect. Steady warming of river temperatures around the median run completion date from {$<$} 8.0 \textdegree C to {$>$} 13.0 \textdegree C was correlated with increased prespawning mortality rates at the hatchery from 1995\textendash 2018. We conclude that warming conditions during migration and spawning, in concert with other factors such as infections with pathogens, are responsible for the increased prespawning mortality of adult sockeye salmon that are high enough to threaten the population's viability.},

  abstract = {Researchers have long recognized the importance of ecological differences at the species level in structuring natural communities yet until recently have often overlooked the influence of intraspecific trait variation, which can profoundly alter community dynamics [1]. Human extraction of living resources can reduce intraspecific trait variation by, for example, causing truncation of age and size structure of populations, where numbers of older individuals decline far more with exploitation than younger individuals. Age truncation can negatively affect population and community stability, increasing variability in population and community biomass [2\textendash 6], reducing productivity [7\textendash 10] and life-history diversity in traits such as the spatial and temporal pattern of reproduction and migration [4, 11\textendash 16]. Here, we quantified the extent of age truncation in 63 fished populations across five ocean regions, as measured by how much the proportions of fish in the oldest age groups declined over time. The proportion of individuals in the oldest age classes decreased significantly in 79\% to 97\% of populations (compared to historical or unfished values, respectively), and the magnitude of decline was greater than 90\% in 32\% to 41\% of populations. The pervasiveness and intensity of age truncation indicates that fishing is likely reducing the stability of many marine communities. Our findings suggest that more emphasis should be given to management measures that reduce the impact of fishing on age truncation, including no-take areas, slot limits that prohibit fishing on all except a narrow range of fish sizes, and rotational harvesting.},

To explore the link between encounters and feeding, we first compiled the largest available dataset of interactions in the marine benthos by extracting data from published studies and generating new data. These data indicate that the size-scaling of feeding interactions varies among consumer groups using different strategies (passive or active) to encounter different resource types (mobile or static), with filter feeders exhibiting the weakest feeding interactions. Next, we used these data to develop an agent-based model of resource biomass encounter rates, underpinned by consumer encounter strategy and resource biomass density. Our model demonstrates that passive strategies for encountering small, dispersed resources limits biomass encounter rates, necessarily limiting the strength of feeding interactions. Our model is based on generalisable assumptions, providing a framework to assess encounter-based drivers of consumption and coexistence across systems.},

In this study we present a framework in which we integrate existing models and knowledge on basic regulatory processes to investigate the potential impact of future scenarios of fisheries exploitation and climate change on the temporal dynamics of the central Baltic herring stock. Alternative scenarios of increasing sea surface temperature and decreasing salinity of the Baltic Sea from a global climate model were combined with two alternative fishing scenarios, and their direct and ecosystem-mediated effects (i.e., through predation by cod and competition with sprat) on the herring population were evaluated for the period 2010\textendash 2050. Gradual increase in temperature has a positive impact on the long-term productivity of the herring stock, but it has the potential to enhance the recovery of the herring stock only in combination with sustainable fisheries management (i.e., Fmsy). Conversely, projections of herring spawning stock biomass (SSB) were generally low under elevated fishing mortality levels (Fhigh), comparable with those experienced by the stock during the 1990s. Under the combined effects of long-term warming and high fishing mortality uncertainty in herring SSB projections was higher and increasing for the duration of the forecasts, suggesting a synergistic effect of fishery exploitation and climate forcing on fish populations dynamics. Our study shows that simulations of long-term fish dynamics can be an informative tool to derive expectations of the potential long-term impact of alternative future scenarios of exploitation and climate change.},

However, the underlying mechanisms of spatial distribution are generally complex due to the concurrent forcing of both density-dependent species interactions and density-independent environmental factors. Despite the high economic value and central ecological importance of cod in the Baltic Sea, the drivers of its spatio-temporal population dynamics have not been analytically investigated so far. In this paper, we used an extensive trawl survey dataset in combination with environmental data to investigate the spatial dynamics of the distribution of the Eastern Baltic cod during the past three decades using Generalized Additive Models. The results showed that adult cod distribution was mainly affected by cod population size, and to a minor degree by small-scale hydrological factors and the extent of suitable reproductive areas. As population size decreases, the cod population concentrates to the southern part of the Baltic Sea, where the preferred more marine environment conditions are encountered. Using the fitted models, we predicted the Baltic cod distribution back to the 1970s and a temporal index of cod spatial occupation was developed. Our study will contribute to the management and conservation of this important resource and of the ecosystem where it occurs, by showing the forces shaping its spatial distribution and therefore the potential response of the population to future exploitation and environmental changes.},

However, in many cases, niche shifts are associated with changes in an underlying continuous trait like body size and we have few predictions concerning conditions for coexistence for such a widespread form of ontogenetic development. We develop a framework for analyzing species coexistence based on Integral Projection Models (IPMs) that incorporates continuous ontogenetic changes in both the resource niche and competitive ability. We parameterize the model using experimental data from Trinidadian guppies and show how niche shifts and competitive symmetries impact species coexistence. Overall, our results show that the effects of competition on fitness depend upon trait-mediated niche-separation, trait-mediated competitive asymmetry in the part of the niche that is shared across body sizes, and the sensitivity of fitness to body size. Interactions among these processes generate multiple routes to coexistence. We discuss how our modelling framework expands results from two-stage models to mutli-stage or continuous stage models and allows for deriving predictions that can be tested in populations displaying continuous changes in niche use and competitive ability.

The strength and directions of these interactions, however, may vary spatially and temporally in regions undergoing widespread landscape changes (e.g., urbanization, agricultural production). We investigated intraguild effects of coyotes (Canis latrans), a de facto apex predator, and land-cover changes on abundance indices of red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) using two long-term and independent time series: direct observations of canids by archery deer hunters (26~years) and harvest data from canid trappers (41~years) from across Illinois, USA. Abundance indices from both time series for red and gray foxes declined whereas coyote abundance indices increased, suggesting increasing coyote abundance may have led to decreases in fox population abundances. Empirical support among candidate models explaining fox declines was generally equivocal yet differed between fox species. Models including effects of coyote abundance were generally competitive for red foxes and estimated negative coyote effects even after controlling for declining farm size. The empirical support among our landscape hypotheses also varied by species despite increasing forest cover and farm size during our study. The estimated effects of coyote in our study were weaker than reported at more northerly latitudes suggesting that increasing coyote populations may not be fully responsible for observed declines in fox populations in the midwestern USA.},

In Europe's Common Fisheries Policy, the share of the catch of each fish stock is split among management areas using a fixed allocation key known as `Relative Stability': in each management area, member states get the same proportion of the total catch each year. That proportion is largely based on catches made by those member states in the 1970s. Changes in distribution can, therefore, result in a mismatch between quota shares and regional abundances within management areas, with potential repercussions for the status of fish stocks and the fisheries that depend on them. Assessing distribution changes is crucial to ensure adequate management and sustainable exploitation of our fish resources. We analysed scientific survey data using a three-tiered analytical approach to provide, for the first time, an overview of changes in distribution for 19 northeast Atlantic fish species encompassing 73 commercial stocks over 30 yr. All species have experienced changes in distribution, five of which did so across management areas. A cross-species analysis suggested that shifts in areas of suitable thermal habitat, and density-dependent use of these areas, are at least partly responsible for the observed changes. These findings challenge the current use of relative stability to allocate quotas.},

The von Bertalanffy growth model was fitted on a cohort-by-cohort basis from 1970 to 2006. The asymptotic L(T) (L(infinity)) was negatively correlated with temperature while the rate at which L(infinity) is reached (K) was positively correlated with temperature. K was negatively correlated with density, whereas no effect on L(infinity) was observed. These effects were incorporated into a von Bertalanffy model which was extended to include temperature and density as explanatory variables. Only the temperature variable was significant. Fitting the extended von Bertalanffy model revealed that L(infinity) decreased while K increased with increasing temperature, resulting in up to a 40\% loss of individual yield at older ages. The dramatic decline observed in the mean age at which 50\% of the population becomes mature suggests that higher temperatures resulted in larger young M. aeglefinus that matured earlier and therefore reached a smaller maximum size. In a global warming context, the loss of individual yield observed at old ages is likely to reduce the fisheries yield for M. aeglefinus in the North Sea.},

The physiology behind the response is well established for ectotherms inhabiting aquatic environments: as higher temperatures decrease the aerobic capacity, individuals with smaller body sizes have a reduced risk of oxygen deprivation. However, empirical evidence of this response at the scale of communities and ecosystems is lacking for marine fish species. Here, we show that over a 40-year period six of eight commercial fish species in the North Sea examined underwent concomitant reductions in asymptotic body size with the synchronous component of the total variability coinciding with a 1-2 degrees C increase in water temperature. Smaller body sizes decreased the yield-per-recruit of these stocks by an average of 23\%. Although it is not possible to ascribe these phenotypic changes unequivocally to temperature, four aspects support this interpretation: (i) the synchronous trend was detected across species varying in their life history and life style; (ii) the decrease coincided with the period of increasing temperature; (iii) the direction of the phenotypic change is consistent with physiological knowledge; and (iv) no cross-species synchrony was detected in other species-specific factors potentially impacting growth. Our findings support a recent model-derived prediction that fish size will shrink in response to climate-induced changes in temperature and oxygen. The smaller body sizes being projected for the future are already detectable in the North Sea.},

Here, we use null models to show that species-climate associations found by climate envelope methods are no better than chance for 68 of 100 European bird species. In line with predictions, we demonstrate that the species with distribution limits determined by climate have more northerly ranges. We conclude that scientific studies and climate change adaptation policies based on the indiscriminate use of climate envelope methods irrespective of species sensitivity to climate may be misleading and in need of revision.},

Increases are believed to be related to shifts in climate but specific, biologically based mechanisms linking climate to increases are not known. At the same time, Pacific salmon abundances in Japan and on Canada's west coast are at historic low levels with attempts to stop the decline unsuccessful. Most juvenile salmon that enter the ocean die, resulting in large abundance increases and decreases from small changes in the already very low ocean survival. Because of this sensitivity to changes in ocean ecosystems and because of the recent basin-scale fluctuations in trends in abundance, I propose that it is time to see a bigger picture and improve the understanding of the biological mechanisms that most influence ocean survival. I leave it to readers to decide if my example of Pacific salmon is part of a more general need in fisheries science to better understand the biological mechanisms linking survival to climate.},

Here, we compare the selection pressures imposed by two distinct patterns of exploitation\textemdash principally targeting spawning or non-spawning aggregations\textemdash on age at maturity among 15 Canadian stocks of Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) that have exhibited a consistent pattern of length-at-age responses to common large-scale environmental drivers since the 1960s. In accordance with expectations for maturity-dependent harvesting, the establishment of a spawner-targeted fishery in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence coincided with a shift towards delayed maturity in both resident stocks, whereas stocks elsewhere subject to fisheries that also exploited juveniles more commonly exhibited trends towards earlier maturity. Despite these differences, we find that environmentally driven changes in length at maturation, combined with total mortality, may overwhelmingly determine lifetime reproductive success and possibly fitness. By linking phenotypic changes experienced in the juvenile period to simple correlates of egg production in mature age classes, our study highlights the importance of managing fisheries in the context of ubiquitous but contrasting environmental constraints on life histories.},

  abstract = {In the Baltic Sea, the large predatory fish northern pike (Esox lucius L.) is important for both recreational fisheries and ecosystem functioning. As existing fishery-independent surveys do not adequately monitor pike populations, a general lack of knowledge on population status and trends poses challenges for management. Here we use recreational angling data as an alternative method to describe pike population development along the Swedish Baltic Sea coast from 1938 onwards and assess the change over time in potential mortality factors by estimating harvest by fisheries and consumption by large predators. Data from a Swedish national register on trophy-sized pike ({$>$}12~kg) showed that numbers and maximum sizes peaked in 1990\textendash 1995, after which declines in both metrics are evident. In logbooks from a sport fishing club in the Stockholm archipelago, a simultaneous decrease in maximum sizes of pike was observed, together with a decrease in the total number of pike caught per fishing day. Jointly, these data indicate a decline in the abundance of large pike since around 1990. While commercial pike fisheries in the Baltic Sea have decreased continuously since the 1950s, recreational fishing increased after 1985, when Swedish coastal waters were made open access to anglers. The declines in large pike starting in the 1990s could, thus, have been driven by an increase in mortality from recreational fisheries, which at the time primarily practiced catch~and~kill. Since the 2000s, bag and slot length limits, spawning closures, and a general increase in catch-and-release fishing has reduced the landings of pike in recreational fisheries. Despite these fisheries regulations and higher release rates the decline in catches of large pike has continued, indicating an effect of other mortality factors. The strong growth of grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) and great cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis) populations suggest that predation pressure on pike has increased over time. In the Stockholm archipelago these two predators were estimated to remove 5\textendash 18 times (range based on different diet composition estimates) more pike biomass than total fisheries landings in 2014\textendash 2017. To improve the situation for northern pike in the Baltic Sea managers need to consider both fisheries restrictions and measures to decrease predation pressure and increase recruitment. Catch data from recreational fisheries may be used to evaluate such management efforts by providing information on the population development of this keystone species.},

We demonstrate how information on the heterogeneity of natural populations can be taken into account when scaling up laboratory-derived process functions, using the technique of moment approximation. We apply moment approximation to a benthic crustacean predator-prey system, where a laboratory-derived functional response is made spatial by including correction terms for the variance in prey density and the covariance between prey and predator densities observed in the field. We also show how moment approximation may be used to incorporate spatial information into a dynamic model of the system. While the nonspatial model predicts stable dynamics, its spatial equivalent also produces bounded fluctuations, in agreement with observed dynamics. A detailed analysis shows that predator-prey covariance, but not prey variance, destabilizes the dynamics. We conclude that second-order moment approximation may provide a useful technique for including spatial information in population models. The main advantage of the method is its conceptual value: by providing explicit estimates of variance and covariance effects, it offers the possibility of understanding how heterogeneity affects ecological processes.},

Relationships between taxa and size classes were studied with correlations at different scales. As similar spatial patterns and correlations appeared at both sites, this suggests that biotic interactions rather than physical factors were responsible for the patterns. We found that several taxa exhibited patchy distributions at the studied scales. In the case of juvenile Monoporeia affinis (Amphipoda) and juvenile Corophium volutator (Amphipoda), we propose that positive intragroup interactions were responsible for the patterns. The correlation analyses suggested that areas with high densities of adult Macoma balthica (Bivalvia) were avoided by juvenile conspecifics and adults of M. affinis and C. volutator, probably because adult M. balthica reduced the amount of detritus in the surficial sediment.},

  abstract = {In the Baltic Sea, the mesopredator three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) spends a large part of its life cycle in the open sea, but reproduces in shallow coastal habitats. In coastal waters, it may occur in high abundances, is a potent predator on eggs and larvae of fish, and has been shown to induce trophic cascades with resulting eutrophication symptoms through regulation of invertebrate grazers. Despite its potential significance for the coastal food web, little is known about its life history and population ecology. This paper provides a description of life history traits, migration patterns and spatiotemporal development of the species in the Baltic Sea during the past decades, and tests the hypothesis that stickleback may have a negative impact on populations of coastal predatory fish. Offshore and coastal data during the last 30 years show that stickleback has increased fourfold in the Bothnian Sea, 45-fold in the Central Baltic Sea and sevenfold in the Southern Baltic Sea. The abundances are similar in the two northern basins, and two orders of magnitude lower in the Southern Baltic Sea. The coastward spawning migration of sticklebacks from offshore areas peaks in early May, with most spawners being two years of age at a mean length of 65~mm. The early juvenile stage is spent at the coast, whereafter sticklebacks perform a seaward feeding migration in early autumn at a size of around 35~mm. A negative spatial relation between the abundance of stickleback and early life stages of perch and pike at coastal spawning areas was observed in spatial survey data, indicating strong interactions between the species. A negative temporal relationship was observed also between adult perch and stickleback in coastal fish monitoring programmes supporting the hypothesis that stickleback may have negative population level effects on coastal fish predators. The recent increase in stickleback populations in different basins of the Baltic Sea in combination with negative spatiotemporal patterns and previously observed interactions between stickleback and coastal predatory fish suggests that this species may have gained a key role in the coastal food webs of the Baltic Sea. Through its migrations, stickleback may also constitute an important vector linking coastal and open sea ecosystem dynamics.},

Fish were fed once a day and faeces was collected by stripping at the end of the growth trial to measure the apparent digestibility of dry matter, energy, nitrogen and phosphorous. Survival was not affected by temperature and was high (87\textendash 100\%) in all treatments. The influence of size (W) on the daily growth rate (DGR, g fish- 1 d-1) was modelled with the power function DGR = {$\alpha$}W{$\gamma$}, where {$\alpha$} and {$\gamma$} are constants fitted with regressions to incorporate the effect of temperature into the model. Following a parabolic response to temperature, DGR and feed intake were high in both size classes across a temperature range extending from 29 \textdegree C to 35 \textdegree C. Temperatures for maximum growth and feed intake lay within the thermal zone for optimal feed efficiency from 26 \textdegree C to 35 \textdegree C. Feed efficiency was higher in small fish than in large fish. Although size had no effect on nutrient digestibility, temperatures influenced the apparent digestibility of dry matter, energy and phosphorous. The partitioning of consumed energy between growth, heat loss, nitrogen excretion and faeces showed increased energy losses through nitrogen excretion at 38 \textdegree C. Size and temperature had significant effects on waste outputs in the form of solid, nitrogen and phosphorous waste. In both size classes lowest levels of waste output were seen from 29 \textdegree C to 35 \textdegree C with levels rising at the cooler temperatures. The energetics and waste output of juvenile barramundi raised at different temperatures are discussed with respect to temperature dependent nutrient digestibility, feed intake and protein turnover.},

  abstract = {Predicting population persistence and dynamics in the context of global change is a major challenge for ecology. A widely held prediction is that population abundance at carrying capacity decreases with warming, assuming no change in resource supply, due to increased individual resource demands associated with higher metabolic rates. However, this prediction, which is based on metabolic scaling theory (MST), has not been tested empirically. Here we experimentally tested whether effects of temperature on short-term metabolic performance (rates of photosynthesis and respiration) translate directly to effects of temperature on population rates in a phytoplankton species. We found that effects of temperature on organismal metabolic rates matched theoretical predictions, and that the temperature dependence of individual metabolic performance translated to population abundance. Population abundance at carrying capacity, K, decreased with temperature less than expected based on the temperature dependence of photosynthesis. Concurrent with declines in abundance, we observed a linear decline in cell size of approximately 2.3\%/\textdegree C, which is consistent with broadly observed patterns in unicellular organisms, known as the temperature-size rule. When theoretical predictions include higher densities allowed by shifts toward smaller individual size, observed declines in K were quantitatively consistent with theoretical predictions. Our results indicate that outcomes of population dynamics across a range of temperatures reflect organismal responses to temperature via metabolic scaling, providing a general basis for forecasting population responses to global change.},

  abstract = {The temperature dependence of highly conserved subcellular metabolic systems affects ecological patterns and processes across scales, from organisms to ecosystems. Population density at carrying capacity plays an important role in evolutionary processes, biodiversity, and ecosystem function, yet how it varies with temperature-dependent metabolism remains unclear. Though the exponential effect of temperature on intrinsic population growth rate, r, is well known, we still lack clear evidence that population density at carrying capacity, K, declines with increasing per capita metabolic rate, as predicted by the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE). We experimentally tested whether temperature effects on photosynthesis propagate directly to population carrying capacity in a model species, the mobile phytoplankton Tetraselmis tetrahele. After maintaining populations at a fixed resource supply and fixed temperatures for 43 days, we found that carrying capacity declined with increasing temperature. This decline was predicted quantitatively when models included temperature-dependent metabolic rates and temperature-associated body-size shifts. Our results demonstrate that warming reduces carrying capacity and that temperature effects on body size and metabolic rate interact to determine how temperature affects population dynamics. These findings bolster efforts to relate metabolic temperature dependence to population and ecosystem patterns via MTE.}

Here, we tested the hypothesis that time-averaged population growth rates in fluctuating thermal environments differ from growth rates in constant conditions as a consequence of Jensen's inequality, and that the thermal performance curves (TPCs) describing population growth in fluctuating environments can be predicted quantitatively based on TPCs generated in constant laboratory conditions. With experimental populations of the green alga Tetraselmis tetrahele, we show that nonlinear averaging techniques accurately predicted increased as well as decreased population growth rates in fluctuating thermal regimes relative to constant thermal regimes. We extrapolate from these results to project critical temperatures for population growth and persistence of 89 phytoplankton species in naturally variable thermal environments.

Surprisingly, we know little about how relevant ecological factors can alter these life history trade-offs and their consequences for individual fitness.

We exposed 412 individuals to a factorial manipulation of food abundance and temperature, tracked each reproductive event, and took daily measurements of body size from each individual. High temperature caused a reduction in maximum body size in both food treatments, but this effect was mediated by food abundance, such that low food conditions resulted in a reduction of 20\% in maximum body size, compared with a reduction of 4\% under high food conditions. High temperature resulted in an accelerated life cycle, with pronounced fitness cost at low levels of food where only a few individuals produced a clutch. These results suggest that the mechanisms affecting the trade-off between fast growth and final body size are food-dependent, and that the combination of low levels of food and high temperature could potentially threaten viability of ectotherms.},

If the distribution of lengths within a particular age is highly skewed, estimates will be severely biased if the data are not treated in a stratified manner.

As well as living in the conventional habitats of lakes, ponds, rivers, rock pools and the open sea, fish have solved the problems of life in deserts, in the deep sea, in the cold antarctic, and in warm waters of high alkalinity or of low oxygen. Along with these adaptations, we find the most impressive specializations of morphology, physiology and behaviour. For example we can marvel at the high-speed swimming of the marlins, sailfish and warm-blooded tunas, air-breathing in catfish and lungfish, parental care in the mouth-brooding cichlids, and viviparity in many sharks and toothcarps. Moreover, fish are of considerable importance to the survival of the human species in the form of nutritious, delicious and diverse food. Rational exploitation and management of our global stocks of fishes must rely upon a detailed and precise insight of their biology.

Using a nonlinear bioenergetic population-dynamic model that accounts for temperature and body-mass dependencies of biological rates, we analysed the individual and interactive effects of increasing temperature and nutrient enrichment on the dynamics of a three-species food chain. At low temperatures, warming counteracts the destabilizing effects of enrichment by both bottom-up (via the carrying capacity) and top-down (via biological rates) mechanisms. Together with increasing consumer body masses, warming increases the system tolerance to fertilization. Simultaneously, warming increases the risk of starvation for large species in low-fertility systems. This effect can be counteracted by increased fertilization. In combination, therefore, two main drivers of global change and biodiversity loss can have positive and negative effects on food chain stability. Our model incorporates the most recent empirical data and may thus be used as the basis for more complex forecasting models incorporating food-web structure.},

We found antagonistic impacts: Warming increases diversity in eutrophic systems and decreases it in oligotrophic systems. These effects interact with the community size structure: Communities of similarly sized species such as parasitoid-host systems are stabilized by warming and destabilized by eutrophication, whereas the diversity of size-structured predator-prey networks decreases strongly with warming, but decreases only weakly with eutrophication. Nonrandom extinction risks for generalists and specialists lead to higher connectance in networks without size structure and lower connectance in size-structured communities. Overall, our results unravel interactive impacts of warming and eutrophication and suggest that size structure may serve as an important proxy for predicting the community sensitivity to these global change stressors.},

It is well known that environmental conditions can have an effect on host-parasite interactions and may thus influence the selection on MHC. We analyzed MHC class II\ss{} variability over 35~years in a population of perch (Perca fluviatilis) from the Baltic Sea that was split into two populations separated from each other. One population was subjected to heating from cooling water of a nuclear power plant and was isolated from the surrounding environment in an artificial lake, while the other population was not subjected to any change in water temperature (control). The isolated population experienced a change of the allelic composition and a decrease in allelic richness of MHC genes compared to the control population. The two most common MHC alleles showed cyclic patterns indicating ongoing parasite-host coevolution in both populations, but the alleles that showed a cyclic behavior differed between the two populations. No such patterns were observed at alleles from nine microsatellite loci, and no genetic differentiation was found between populations. We found no indications for a genetic bottleneck in the isolated population during the 35~years. Additionally, differences in parasitism of the current perch populations suggest that a change of the parasite communities has occurred over the isolation period, although the evidence in form of in-depth knowledge of the change of the parasite community over time is lacking. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis of a selective sweep imposed by a change in the parasite community.},

The halibut were fed dry feed in experiments A and B, and fish (capelin and herring) in experiment C. In all three experiments growth rate and growth efficiency peaked at intermediate temperatures. Optimal temperature for growth decreased with increasing fish size, being approximately 14\textdegree C for IO-60 g fish, 11.4''C for 100-500 g fish and 9.7''C for 3-5 kg fish. Optimal temperature for growth efficiency also decreased with increasing fish size, being approximately 14\textdegree C for IO-60 g fish, 10.6''C for 100-500 g fish and 5.5''C for 3-5 kg fish. The dome-shaped relationships of growth rate and growth efficiency versus temperature became flatter with increased size of fish, suggesting that thermal sensitivity close to the optimum decreases as fish size increases.},

  abstract = {The attempt to identify and explain pattern in the extent of species' geographical distributions at regional scales has been central to macroecology. However, with the exception of abundance, consistent relations between other variables and species geographic extent have not been forthcoming. One reason may be that studies often encompass the entire geographic ranges of only a fraction of the species in the taxon under consideration, setting biologically artificial boundaries to the area of study, and only revealing part of the pattern in question. Here, we examine patterns in the geographic range sizes of birds in the New World. By testing for patterns in the entire avifauna of a geographically isolated region (95\% of species are endemic), we avoid many of the problems of previous studies. Most New World bird species have small geographic ranges, although the frequency distribution of logarithmically transformed ranges is left-skewed. The geographic range size-body size relation is approximately triangular. Small-bodied species may have either large or small ranges, whereas large-bodied species have only large ranges. Species threatened with extinction more often fall nearer to (or below) the lower edge defined by the majority of species in this triangle than do non-threatened species, suggesting that this represents the minimum area needed to sustain viable populations of species of different sizes. The maximum range size attained by species is relatively constant across body sizes, but falls short of the maximum possible given the land area of the New World, and so cannot be limited by this constraint. What does limit maximum range size is thus unclear. There is a latitudinal gradient in the size of species geographic ranges. Species which have the latitudinal mid-point of their geographic ranges at high latitudes either side of the equator tend to have large range sizes, whereas those with mid-points at lower latitudes tend to have small range sizes (as expected from Rapoport's rule). However, this pattern is not symmetrical about the equator, but rather, at about 17\textdegree{} N. It appears to be a consequence of the biogeography of the New World, and implies that mechanisms suggested to explain Rapoport's rule based on climatic variability are incorrect. Migrant birds have larger geographic ranges, on average, than do residents. They are also larger-bodied, and tend to inhabit more northerly latitudes than residents, but their larger ranges are not the simple consequence of these other patterns. The patterns we demonstrate, in particular those relating to maximum range size across body sizes and to latitudinal variation in range size, have significant consequences for the understanding of what determines species geographic range sizes.}

Here, we develop a size-based model that incorporates dynamic interactions between marine benthic (detritus-based) and pelagic (primary producer based) pathways to investigate how the coupling of these pathways affects food web stability and resilience. All model configurations produced stable steady-state size spectra. Resilience was measured by the return speed obtained from local stability analysis. Return times following large perturbations away from steady-state were also measured. Resilience varied nonlinearly with both predator and detrital coupling, and high resilience came from predators (1) feeding entirely in the slow benthic zone or (2) feeding across the two energy pathways, with most food coming from the fast pelagic pathway. When most of the energy flowed through the pelagic pathway, resilience was positively related to turnover rate. When most of the energy flowed through the benthic pathway, resilience was negatively related to turnover rate. Analysis of the effects of large perturbations revealed that resilience for pelagic ecosystems depended on the nature of the perturbation and the degree of benthic\textendash pelagic coupling. Areas with very little or no benthic\textendash pelagic coupling (e.g. deep seas or highly stratified water columns) may return more quickly following pulses of detrital fallout or primary production but could be much less resilient to the effects of human-induced mortality (harvesting).},

  abstract = {1 Widely observed macro-ecological patterns in log abundance vs. log body mass of organisms can be explained by simple scaling theory based on food (energy) availability across a spectrum of body sizes. The theory predicts that when food availability falls with body size (as in most aquatic food webs where larger predators eat smaller prey), the scaling between log N vs. log m is steeper than when organisms of different sizes compete for a shared unstructured resource (e.g. autotrophs, herbivores and detritivores; hereafter dubbed `detritivores'). 2 In real communities, the mix of feeding characteristics gives rise to complex food webs. Such complexities make empirical tests of scaling predictions prone to error if: (i) the data are not disaggregated in accordance with the assumptions of the theory being tested, or (ii) the theory does not account for all of the trophic interactions within and across the communities sampled. 3 We disaggregated whole community data collected in the North Sea into predator and detritivore components and report slopes of log abundance vs. log body mass relationships. Observed slopes for fish and epifaunal predator communities (\textendash 1{$\cdot$}2 to \textendash 2{$\cdot$}25) were significantly steeper than those for infaunal detritivore communities (\textendash 0{$\cdot$}56 to \textendash 0{$\cdot$}87). 4 We present a model describing the dynamics of coupled size spectra, to explain how coupling of predator and detritivore communities affects the scaling of log N vs. log m. The model captures the trophic interactions and recycling of material that occur in many aquatic ecosystems. 5 Our simulations demonstrate that the biological processes underlying growth and mortality in the two distinct size spectra lead to patterns consistent with data. Slopes of log N vs. log m were steeper and growth rates faster for predators compared to detritivores. Size spectra were truncated when primary production was too low for predators and when detritivores experienced predation pressure. 6 The approach also allows us to assess the effects of external sources of mortality (e.g. harvesting). Removal of large predators resulted in steeper predator spectra and increases in their prey (small fish and detritivores). The model predictions are remarkably consistent with observed patterns of exploited ecosystems.},

These capture the properties of food webs that describe energy flux and production at a particular size, independent of species' ecology. We couple a physical-biogeochemical model with a dynamic, size-based food web model to predict the future effects of climate change on fish biomass and production in 11 large regional shelf seas, with and without fishing effects. Changes in potential fish production are shown to most strongly mirror changes in phytoplankton production. We project declines of 30-60\% in potential fish production across some important areas of tropical shelf and upwelling seas, most notably in the eastern Indo-Pacific, the northern Humboldt and the North Canary Current. Conversely, in some areas of the high latitude shelf seas, the production of pelagic predators was projected to increase by 28-89\%.},

  abstract = {In many exploited marine fish species, older individuals within cohorts often have slower growth rates at age than their younger counterparts, a process generally attributed to fishing. However, environmental changes might also contribute to the selective disappearance of faster growing individuals because of the increasing constraints acting on growth in suboptimal environments. Using otoliths of anchovy and sardine collected each year in spring since 2000 in the Bay of Biscay, we measured individuals' growth during age-0 and catch-up growth during age-1, and followed their changes in time from 2000 to 2018 to quantify the magnitude of selective mortality. We then determined whether the variations in growth and selective mortality were related to seasonal temperature, food quantity, stock biomass or stock harvest rate. In both species, there was a decline in growth during age 0 over time and a catch-up growth declined in anchovy. Density-dependence had a strong effect on growth in anchovy. In both species, there was a systematic selective disappearance of individuals with large growth at age-0 within each cohort and selection has changed over time to favour individuals with large catch-up growth in anchovy. Moreover, diversifying selection occurred for growth at age-0 in both species and catch-up growth in anchovy. In anchovy, years with high selective disappearance of large individuals, high catch-up growth and high diversifying selection were those in which the harvest rates were high (environmental variables having more limited effect). In sardine, the selective disappearance of large individuals was stronger in years with low food quantity and the magnitude of selection acting on growth was unrelated to this stock's harvest rate. Though fishing exerted strong selection pressure in anchovy, selective mortality against large growth still occurred even at low harvest rates in both species, suggesting that this might be a natural process affecting these small pelagic forage fish species. Although anchovy and sardine have a similar trophic position, their selection regimes differed due to differences in their stock dynamics, environmental sensitivity, and fishing rate. It might therefore be hazardous to extrapolate the responses of single species to environmental and anthropogenic factors onto others.},

  abstract = {Studies dealing with the effects of changing global temperatures on living organisms typically concentrate on annual mean temperatures. This, however, might not be the best approach in temperate systems with large seasonality where the mean annual temperature is actually not experienced very frequently. The mean annual temperature across a 50-year, daily time series of measurements at Helgoland Roads (54.2 degrees N, 7.9 degrees E) is 10.1 degrees C while seasonal data are characterized by a clear, bimodal distribution; temperatures are around 6 degrees C in winter and 15 degrees C in summer with rapid transitions in spring and autumn. Across those 50 years, the temperature at which growth is maximal for each single bloom event for 115 phytoplankton species (more than 6000 estimates of optimal temperature) mirrors the bimodal distribution of the in situ temperatures. Moreover, independent laboratory data on temperature optima for growth of North Sea organisms yielded similar results: a deviance from the normal distribution, with a gap close to the mean annual temperature, and more optima either above or below this temperature. We conclude that organisms, particularly those that are short-lived, are either adapted to the prevailing winter or summer temperatures in temperate areas and that few species exist with thermal optima within the periods characterized by rapid spring warming and autumn cooling.},

Nonnormal data such as counts or proportions often defy classical statistical procedures. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) provide a more flexible approach for analyzing nonnormal data when random effects are present. The explosion of research on GLMMs in the last decade has generated considerable uncertainty for practitioners in ecology and evolution. Despite the availability of accurate techniques for estimating GLMM parameters in simple cases, complex GLMMs are challenging to fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult. We review the use (and misuse) of GLMMs in ecology and evolution, discuss estimation and inference and summarize `best-practice' data analysis procedures for scientists facing this challenge.},

Why might intraspecific variation alter ecological dynamics? In this review we synthesize recent theory and identify six general mechanisms by which trait variation changes the outcome of ecological interactions. These mechanisms include several direct effects of trait variation per se and indirect effects arising from the role of genetic variation in trait evolution. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Several phenomenological descriptions, such as the von Bertalanffy growth model, have been widely used to describe size-at-age and individual growth across a diverse range of organisms. However, for modelling life histories, as opposed to just growth, biologically and mechanistically meaningful growth models, based on allocation decisions, have become increasingly important. This is because fitness is determined by survival and reproduction, which are not addressed directly in phenomenological growth models. To elucidate these considerations, we take as a starting point the biphasic growth model by Quince et al. (2008a, J. Theor. Biol. 254:197) which has the advantage that the underlying allometric scaling of net energy intake can be freely chosen. First, we reformulate this model such that individual size is given in meaningful units of length and weight, facilitating the model's interpretation and application. Second, we show that even though different allometric scaling relationships can produce practically identical growth trajectories, the accompanying reproductive investments are highly dependent on the chosen allometric exponent. Third, we demonstrate how this dependence has dramatic consequences for evolutionary predictions, in particular with regard to the age and size at maturation. These findings have considerable practical relevance, because empirically observed allometric exponents are often uncertain and systematically differ from those assumed in current standard growth models.},

Proportional contributions to references, taking into account number of authors, author order and other key factors, revealed Bill Ricker and John Roland Brett as the greatest individual contributors, and the US, Canada and the UK as greatest country contributors, with Canada significantly over-represented. Female represen- tation on the list was historically low before increasing to 21\% in the 1990s, and reflected gender changes in the field of fisheries. When compared to \textbackslash textgreater2000 control papers published in the same journal and year, highly cited fisheries papers were significantly longer (20.4 vs. 9.8 pages) and had more authors (5.8 vs. 4.3), refer- ences (118 vs. 51), tables and total illustrations; these differences were greater when high-profile general journals were excluded, but lower when calculated on a per-page basis. References with more than six authors jumped from 0 to 27\% in 2000, coinciding with a rapid uptake of email among fisheries scientists. Overall, we find no shortcut to publishing highly cited references: they require substantial time, effort and knowledge invested in new hypotheses, textbooks, field guides, new discoveries, broad meta-analyses, new methods and reviews.},

A number of climate-related threats to both capture fisheries and aquaculture are identified, but we have low confidence in predictions of future fisheries production because of uncertainty over future global aquatic net primary production and the transfer of this production through the food chain to human consumption. Recent changes in the distribution and productivity of a number of fish species can be ascribed with high confidence to regional climate variability, such as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation. Future production may increase in some high-latitude regions because of warming and decreased ice cover, but the dynamics in low-latitude regions are governed by different processes, and production may decline as a result of reduced vertical mixing of the water column and, hence, reduced recycling of nutrients. There are strong interactions between the effects of fishing and the effects of climate because fishing reduces the age, size, and geographic diversity of populations and the biodiversity of marine ecosystems, making both more sensitive to additional stresses such as climate change. Inland fisheries are additionally threatened by changes in precipitation and water management. The frequency and intensity of extreme climate events is likely to have a major impact on future fisheries production in both inland and marine systems. Reducing fishing mortality in the majority of fisheries, which are currently fully exploited or overexploited, is the principal feasible means of reducing the impacts of climate change.},

Because hypoxia can cause mortality, reduced growth rates, and altered distributions and behaviors of fishes, as well as changes in the relative importance of organisms and pathways of carbon flow within food webs, hypoxia and anoxia can lead to large reductions in the abundance, diversity, and harvest of fishes within affected waters. Nutrient enrichment, however, typically increases prey abundance in more highly oxygenated surface waters and beyond the boundaries of the hypoxic zone. Because of this mosaic of high and low oxygen areas within a system, not only the actual oxygen concentration of bottom waters, but the spatial arrangement, predictability, and persistence of highly oxygenated, high productivity habitats, and the ability of fishes to locate and use those favorable habitats, will determine the ultimate effect of low oxygen on fish populations. Negative effects of hypoxia on fish, habitat, and food webs potentially make both fish populations and entire systems more susceptible to additional anthropogenic and natural stressors.},

However, few studies have directly investigated the dependence of thermal limits on oxygen transport capacity. By manipulating oxygen availability (via environmental hyperoxia) and blood oxygen carrying capacity (via experimentally induced anaemia) in European perch (Perca fluviatilis Linneaus), we investigated the effects of oxygen transport capacity on aerobic scope and the critical thermal maximum (CT(max)). Hyperoxia resulted in a twofold increase in aerobic scope at the control temperature of 23 degrees C, but this did not translate to an elevated CT(max) in comparison with control fish (34.6+/-0.1 versus 34.0+/-0.5 degrees C, respectively). Anaemia ( approximately 43\% reduction in haemoglobin concentration) did not cause a reduction in aerobic scope or CT(max) (33.8+/-0.3 degrees C) compared with control fish. Additionally, oxygen consumption rates of anaemic perch during thermal ramping increased in a similar exponential manner to that in control fish, highlighting that perch have an impressive capacity to compensate for a substantial reduction in blood oxygen carrying capacity. Taken together, these results indicate that oxygen limitation is not a universal mechanism determining the CT(max) of fishes.},

With a myriad of model types, methods and parameterization options available, it is challenging to make informed decisions about how to build robust SDMs appropriate for a given purpose. One key component of SDM development is the appropriate parameterization of covariates, such as the inclusion of covariates that reflect underlying processes (e.g. abiotic and biotic covariates) and covariates that act as proxies for unobserved processes (e.g. space and time covariates). It is unclear how different SDMs apportion variance among a suite of covariates, and how parameterization decisions influence model accuracy and performance. To examine trade-offs in covariation parameterization in SDMs, we explore the attribution of spatiotemporal and environmental variation across a suite of SDMs. We first used simulated species distributions with known environmental preferences to compare three types of SDM: a machine learning model (boosted regression tree), a semi-parametric model (generalized additive model) and a spatiotemporal mixed-effects model (vector autoregressive spatiotemporal model, VAST). We then applied the same comparative framework to a case study with three fish species (arrowtooth flounder, pacific cod and walleye pollock) in the eastern Bering Sea, USA. Model type and covariate parameterization both had significant effects on model accuracy and performance. We found that including either spatiotemporal or environmental covariates typically reproduced patterns of species distribution and abundance across the three models tested, but model accuracy and performance was maximized when including both spatiotemporal and environmental covariates in the same model framework. Our results reveal trade-offs in the current generation of SDM tools between accurately estimating species abundance, accurately estimating spatial patterns, and accurately quantifying underlying species\textendash environment relationships. These comparisons between model types and parameterization options can help SDM users better understand sources of model bias and estimate error.},

Two offshore spawning areas were identified in the central North Sea \textendash{} central-northern and central-southern. A general linear model (GLM) showed plaice sexual maturation was influenced by body weight, age and geographical location and was subject to annual and seasonal variation. Few three year old female place appeared to spawn in the central North Sea, similar to the situation early in the 20th century. The condition factor of plaice peaked at the start of spawning and declined sharply during spawning, with older females investing the most heavily in reproduction, both in absolute and relative terms. The loss of older females through fishing is, therefore, likely to compromise the overall reproductive fitness of the remaining population, comprising of young females. The reproductive fitness of the males was also compromised, since young males tended to be in running condition for about a month less than older males. Reproductive investment in females was about twice the level found in males. There was evidence that plaice in the northern North Sea matured at a slower rate than fish in the south. From the mid-1980s until the mid-1990s there was an increase in the proportion of young plaice reaching sexual maturity, following an earlier decline from the late 1970s. Problems with using maturity ogives derived from market sampling data in order to assess the proportion of spawning plaice in the North Sea are discussed.},

  abstract = {Classic local stability theory predicts that complex ecological networks are unstable and are unlikely to persist despite empiricists' abundant documentation of such complexity in nature. This contradiction has puzzled biologists for decades. While some have explored how stability may be achieved in small modules of a few interacting species, rigorous demonstrations of how large complex and ecologically realistic networks dynamically persist remain scarce and inadequately understood. Here, we help fill this void by combining structural models of complex food webs with nonlinear bioenergetic models of population dynamics parameterized by biological rates that are allometrically scaled to populations' average body masses. Increasing predator\textendash prey body mass ratios increase population persistence up to a saturation level that is reached by invertebrate and ectotherm vertebrate predators when being 10 or 100 times larger than their prey respectively. These values are corroborated by empirical predator\textendash prey body mass ratios from a global data base. Moreover, negative effects of diversity (i.e. species richness) on stability (i.e. population persistence) become neutral or positive relationships at these empirical ratios. These results demonstrate that the predator\textendash prey body mass ratios found in nature may be key to enabling persistence of populations in complex food webs and stabilizing the diversity of natural ecosystems.},

In community and population ecology, there is a chronic gap between the classic Eltonian ecology describing patterns in abundance and body mass across species and ecosystems and the more process oriented foraging ecology addressing interactions and quantitative population dynamics. However, this dichotomy is arbitrary, because body mass also determines most species traits affecting foraging interactions and population dynamics. 2. In this review, allometric (body-mass dependent) scaling of handling times and attack rates are documented, whereas body-mass effects on Hill exponents (varying between hyperbolic type II and sigmoid type III functional responses) and predator interference coefficients are lacking. This review describes how these allometric relationships define a biological plausible parameter space for population dynamic models. 3. Consistent with the classic Eltonian description, species co-existence in consumer-resource models and tri-trophic food chains is restricted to intermediate consumer-resource body-mass ratios. Allometric population dynamic models allow understanding the processes of energy limitation and unstable dynamics leading to this restriction. Complex food webs are stabilized by high predator-prey body-mass ratios, which are consistent with those found in natural ecosystems. These high body-mass ratios yield positive diversity-stability and complexity-stability relationships thus supporting the classic picture of ecosystem stability. 4. Allometric-trophic network models, based on body mass and trophic information from ecosystems, bridge the gap between Eltonian community patterns and process-oriented foraging ecology and provide a new means to describe the dynamics and functioning of natural ecosystems.},

In this theme issue, we highlight a novel pathway through which warming indirectly affects ecological communities: by changing their size structure (i.e. the body-size distributions). Warming can shift these distributions towards dominance of small- over large-bodied species. The conceptual, theoretical and empirical research described in this issue, in sum, suggests that effects of temperature may be dominated by changes in size structure, with relatively weak direct effects. For example, temperature effects via size structure have implications for top-down and bottom-up control in ecosystems and may ultimately yield novel communities. Moreover, scaling up effects of temperature and body size from physiology to the levels of populations, communities and ecosystems may provide a crucially important mechanistic approach for forecasting future consequences of global warming.},

  abstract = {Understanding the consequences of species loss in complex ecological communities is one of the great challenges in current biodiversity research. For a long time, this topic has been addressed by traditional biodiversity experiments. Most of these approaches treat species as trait-free, taxonomic units characterizing communities only by species number without accounting for species traits. However, extinctions do not occur at random as there is a clear correlation between extinction risk and species traits. In this review, we assume that large species will be most threatened by extinction and use novel allometric and size-spectrum concepts that include body mass as a primary species trait at the levels of populations and individuals, respectively, to re-assess three classic debates on the relationships between biodiversity and (i) food-web structural complexity, (ii) community dynamic stability, and (iii) ecosystem functioning. Contrasting current expectations, size-structured approaches suggest that the loss of large species, that typically exploit most resource species, may lead to future food webs that are less interwoven and more structured by chains of interactions and compartments. The disruption of natural body-mass distributions maintaining food-web stability may trigger avalanches of secondary extinctions and strong trophic cascades with expected knock-on effects on the functionality of the ecosystems. Therefore, we argue that it is crucial to take into account body size as a species trait when analysing the consequences of biodiversity loss for natural ecosystems. Applying size-structured approaches provides an integrative ecological concept that enables a better understanding of each species' unique role across communities and the causes and consequences of biodiversity loss.},

All organisms compete for a limited supply of organic chemical energy, derived mostly from photosynthesis, to invest in the two components of fitness: survival and production. All organisms are mortal because molecular and cellular damage accumulates over the lifetime; life persists only because parents produce offspring. We call this the equal fitness paradigm. The equal fitness paradigm occurs because: (1) there is a trade-off between generation time and productive power, which have equal-but-opposite scalings with body size and temperature; smaller and warmer organisms have shorter lifespans but produce biomass at higher rates than larger and colder organisms; (2) the energy content of biomass is essentially constant, \textasciitilde 22.4 kJ g-1 dry body weight; and (3) the fraction of biomass production incorporated into surviving offspring is also roughly constant, \textasciitilde 10\textendash 50\%. As organisms transmit approximately the same quantity of energy per gram to offspring in the next generation, no species has an inherent lasting advantage in the struggle for existence. The equal fitness paradigm emphasizes the central importance of energy, biological scaling relations and power\textendash time trade-offs in life history, ecology and evolution.},

Metabolic theory predicts how metabolic rate, by setting the rates of resource uptake from the environment and resource allocation to survival, growth, and reproduction, controls ecological processes at all levels of organization from individuals to the biosphere. Examples include: (1) life history attributes, including development rate, mortality rate, age at maturity, life span, and population growth rate; (2) population interactions, including carrying capacity, rates of competition and predation, and patterns of species diversity; and (3) ecosystem processes, including rates of biomass production and respiration and patterns of trophic dynamics.},

The application of metabolic scaling theory has advanced our understanding of the influence of temperature on pattern and process in marine communities. Metabolic scaling theory uses the fundamental and ubiquitous patterns of temperature-dependent metabolism to predict how environmental temperature influences patterns and processes at higher levels of biological organization. Here, we outline some of these predictions to review recent advances and illustrate how scaling theory might be applied to new challenges. For example, warming can alter species interactions and food-web structure and can also reduce total animal biomass supportable by a given amount of primary production by increasing animal metabolism and energetic demand. Additionally, within a species, larval development is faster in warmer water, potentially influencing dispersal and other demographic processes like population connectivity and gene flow. These predictions can be extended further to address major questions in marine ecology, and present an opportunity for conceptual unification of marine ecological research across levels of biological organization. Drawing on work by ecologists and oceanographers over the last century, a metabolic scaling approach represents a promising way forward for applying ecological understanding to basic questions as well as conservation challenges.},

Stakeholders can be members of LVSWC, which also organises a fisheries co-management group mainly dealing with fisheries issues. Ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) is a widely desired framework shaped to focus on ecosystems, involve stakeholders, and address environmental issues in an adaptive, integrated and holistic manner while also including societal aspects. We have investigated how the management of Lake V\"attern relates to 15 central principles for EBFM. The study found that LVSWC and the fisheries co-management group work along and towards the EBFM principles in a locally adapted way. Several environmental improvements have been observed concurrently with LVSWC activity, such as increased water clarity, and a strengthened stock of the Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus). Long-term commitment by European, national and regional authorities was seen as essential to maintain and improve EBFM functions for Lake V\"attern, to ensure continuity in the work, rather than having to depend on short projects. Becasue literature examples of EBFM in lakes are scarce worldwide, this study provides a unique example of the pursuit of EBFM in lake ecosystem management.},

Scientific cod stock related advice for targeted and mixed fisheries is provided on an annual basis by the International Council for Exploration of the Sea. This advice forms a basis for ministerial decisions on, e.g., the total allowable catch and management plans. Despite measures to reduce fishing-induced mortality of cod, such as catch and effort restrictions, increased gear selectivity, closed areas and seasons, clear signs of recovery are yet to be seen. Thus, traditional advice for the management of these stocks may have to be complemented by advice on supporting measures focusing on other pressures hampering the recovery of cod. The present study elaborates on potential supportive measures for cod stock recovery in the Baltic Sea, Kattegat, and Skagerrak (including local populations where applicable), based on current knowledge. The list of measures presented here is the outcome of in-depth discussions on the state-of-the-art knowledge, among cod experts and further with stakeholders with the aim to follow principles of ecosystem-based fisheries management. Following the identification of different pressures on and prerequisites for the separate stocks, the listed measures differ between stocks and include cod bycatch mortality reduction, alterations in fisheries affecting food sources for cod, restocking, protection of juvenile habitats, and reduced predation. The literature review and the list of measures are intended to provide decision-support for managers and policymakers aiming to provide conditions for the cod stocks to recover.},

One of the most studied declines in size at age has been in populations of salmon; Chinook salmon in the Northeast Pacific Ocean are the largest bodied salmon species and have experienced long-term declines in size. Using long-term monitoring data, we develop novel size and growth models to link observed changes in Chinook size to life history traits and environmental variability. Our results identify three distinct trends in size across the 48 stocks in our study. Differences among populations were correlated with ocean distribution, migration timing, and freshwater residence. We provide evidence that trends are driven by interannual variation in certain oceanographic processes and competition with pink salmon.},

  abstract = {Climate change projections are central to fisheries and aquatic conservation research, and to planning for a warming world. Projections require assumptions about future emissions pathways and climate-system sensitivity to emissions. Fisheries and aquatic conservation research typically uses emissions scenarios created for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). However, recent climate research and global development trends have significantly changed our understanding of the ranges of plausible emissions pathways to 2100 and climate sensitivities. Here, we provide a concise review of these developments, and we make recommendations for climate change scenario use in fisheries and aquatic conservation research. Although emissions pathways are uncertain, recent research suggests that emissions scenarios producing a range of approximately 3.4-4.5W/m\^2 radiative forcing by 2100 might be most plausible. This corresponds to approximately 2-3 degrees C global warming by 2100 with median climate sensitivities, or 1.5-4 degrees C considering climate-sensitivity uncertainties. In terms of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), plausible scenarios mostly fall between SSP2-3.4 and SSP2-4.5/RCP4.5, though higher- and lower-emissions scenarios (e.g., RCP2.6 and RCP6.0) might be plausible and should be explored in research. However, we argue that uses of high-emission scenarios (RCP8.5/SSP5-8.5, SSP3-7.0) should come with clear rationales and appropriate caveats to ensure results are not misinterpreted by scholars, policymakers, and media. We analyze fisheries and aquatic conservation papers from 2015-2021 in four major journals, and find RCP8.5 is the most commonly used scenario. These studies predominantly project quantitative, rather than qualitative, differences between RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 impacts.},

  abstract = {Many analyses of biological responses to climate rely on gridded climate data derived from weather stations, which differ from the conditions experienced by organisms in at least two respects. First, the microclimate recorded by a weather station is often quite different to that near the ground surface, where many organisms live. Second, the temporal and spatial resolutions of gridded climate datasets derived from weather stations are often too coarse to capture the conditions experienced by organisms. Temporally and spatially coarse data have clear benefits in terms of reduced model size and complexity, but here we argue that coarse-grained data introduce errors that, in biological studies, are too often ignored. However, in contrast to common perception, these errors are not necessarily caused directly by a spatial mismatch between the size of organisms and the scale at which climate data are collected. Rather, errors and biases are primarily due to (a) systematic discrepancies between the climate used in analysis and that experienced by organisms under study; and (b) the non-linearity of most biological responses in combination with differences in climate variance between locations and time periods for which models are fitted and those for which projections are made. We discuss when exactly problems of scale can be expected to arise and highlight the potential to circumvent these by spatially and temporally down-scaling climate. We also suggest ways in which adjustments to deal with issues of scale could be made without the need to run high-resolution models over wide extents.},

  abstract = {Aim The factors that set species range limits underlie many patterns in ecology, evolution, biogeography and conservation. These factors have been the subject of several reviews, but there has been no systematic review of the causes of warm-edge limits (low elevations and latitudes). Understanding these causes is urgent, given that the factors that set these limits might also drive extinction at warm edges as global climate changes. Many authors have suggested that warm-edge limits are set by biotic factors (particularly competition) whereas others have stressed abiotic factors (particularly temperature). We synthesize the known causes of species' warm-edge range limits, with emphasis on the underlying mechanisms (proximate causes). Location Global. Methods We systematically searched the literature for studies testing the causes of warm-edge range limits. Results We found 125 studies that address the causes of warm-edge limits, from a search including {$>$} 4000 studies. Among the species in these studies, abiotic factors are supported more often than biotic factors in setting species range limits at warm edges, in contrast to the widely held view that biotic factors are more important. Studies that test both types of factors support abiotic factors significantly more frequently. In addition, only 23 studies (61 species) identified proximate causes of these limits, and these overwhelmingly support physiological tolerances to abiotic factors (primarily temperature). Only eight species with identified proximate causes were tested for both biotic and abiotic factors, but the majority support abiotic factors. Main conclusions Although it is often assumed that warm-edge limits are set by biotic factors, our review shows that abiotic factors are supported more often among the species in these 125 studies. However, few studies both identify proximate causes and test alternative mechanisms, or examine the interaction between biotic and abiotic factors. Filling these gaps should be a high priority as warm-edge populations are increasingly driven to extinction by climate change.},

This is a problem because such relationships are taken to be the primary descriptors of density dependence, responsible for regulating population density. In this paper, we show that small pelagic fish species, anchovy (Engraulis spp., Engraulidae), living in a stochastic environment, can be strongly regulated without a stock\textendash recruitment relationship emerging. This is done through numerical analysis of a size-spectrum model, in which fish grow by eating and die in part from being eaten, with the result that birth, growth and death are all density-dependent. The model includes cannibalism, and growth-dependent larval mortality, both of which have been suggested as regulatory mechanisms in anchovy, together with growth and reproduction later in life. Despite the lack of a clear stock\textendash recruitment relationship in the presence of stochasticity, signals of density dependence in the vital rates remain clear, suggesting that they might prove to be better indicators of density dependence than stock\textendash recruitment relationships in small pelagic fish.},

Differences between the planktonic prey availability, selectivity, and predation between anchovy and sardine have been suggested as factors influencing their dynamics. Using a dynamical multispecies size-spectrum model, we explore the consequences of changes in plankton size composition, together with intraguild predation and cannibalism, on the coexistence of these species. The shift towards smaller plankton has led to a reduction in the growth rate of both species. The effect was more deleterious on anchovy growth because it is unable to filter small particles. In model scenarios that included the effects of cannibalism and predation, anchovy typically collapsed under conditions favouring smaller sized plankton. The two species coexisted under conditions of larger sized plankton, although strong predation in conjunction with weak cannibalism led to the loss of sardine. The model provides new testable predictions for the consequences of plankton size structure on anchovy and sardine fluctuations. Further empirical work is needed to test these predictions in the context of climate change.},

  abstract = {Characterizing population distribution and abundance over space and time is central to population ecology and conservation of natural populations. However, species distribution models and population dynamic models have rarely been integrated into a single modelling framework. Consequently, fine-scale spatial heterogeneity is often ignored in resource assessments. We develop and test a novel spatiotemporal assessment framework to better address fine-scale spatial heterogeneities based on theories of fish population dynamic and spatiotemporal statistics. The spatiotemporal model links species distribution and population dynamic models within a single statistical framework that is flexible enough to permit inference for each state variable through space and time. We illustrate the model with a simulation\textendash estimation experiment tailored to two exploited marine species: snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio, Oregoniidae) in the Eastern Bering Sea and northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis, Pandalidae) in the Gulf of Maine. These two species have different types of life history. We compare the spatiotemporal model with a spatially aggregated model and systematically evaluate the spatiotemporal model based on simulation experiments. We show that the spatiotemporal model can recover spatial patterns in population and exploitation pressure as well as provide unbiased estimates of spatially aggregated population quantities. The spatiotemporal model also implicitly accounts for individual movement rates and can outperform spatially aggregated models by accounting for time-and-size varying selectivity caused by spatial heterogeneity. We conclude that spatiotemporal modelling framework is a feasible and promising approach to address the spatial structure of natural resource populations, which is a major challenge in understanding population dynamics and conducting resource assessments and management.},

  abstract = {Metrics that synthesize the complex effects of climate change are essential tools for mapping future threats to biodiversity and predicting which species are likely to adapt in place to new climatic conditions, disperse and establish in areas with newly suitable climate, or face the prospect of extirpation. The most commonly used of such metrics is the velocity of climate change, which estimates the speed at which species must migrate over the earth's surface to maintain constant climatic conditions. However, ``analog-based'' velocities, which represent the actual distance to where analogous climates will be found in the future, may provide contrasting results to the more common form of velocity based on local climate gradients. Additionally, whereas climatic velocity reflects the exposure of organisms to climate change, resultant biotic effects are dependent on the sensitivity of individual species as reflected in part by their climatic niche width. This has motivated development of biotic velocity, a metric which uses data on projected species range shifts to estimate the velocity at which species must move to track their climatic niche. We calculated climatic and biotic velocity for the Western Hemisphere for 1961\textendash 2100, and applied the results to example ecological and conservation planning questions, to demonstrate the potential of such analog-based metrics to provide information on broad-scale patterns of exposure and sensitivity. Geographic patterns of biotic velocity for 2954 species of birds, mammals, and amphibians differed from climatic velocity in north temperate and boreal regions. However, both biotic and climatic velocities were greatest at low latitudes, implying that threats to equatorial species arise from both the future magnitude of climatic velocities and the narrow climatic tolerances of species in these regions, which currently experience low seasonal and interannual climatic variability. Biotic and climatic velocity, by approximating lower and upper bounds on migration rates, can inform conservation of species and locally-adapted populations, respectively, and in combination with backward velocity, a function of distance to a source of colonizers adapted to a site's future climate, can facilitate conservation of diversity at multiple scales in the face of climate change.},

However, understanding changes in spatial overlap between predators and their prey might provide deeper insight into how species redistribution affects food web dynamics. Predator\textendash prey overlap metrics Here, we review a suite of 10 metrics [range overlap, area overlap, the local index of collocation (Pianka's O), Hurlbert's index, biomass-weighted overlap, asymmetrical alpha, Schoener's D, Bhattacharyya's coefficient, the global index of collocation and the AB ratio] that describe how two species overlap in space, using concepts such as binary co-occurrence, encounter rates, spatial niche similarity, spatial independence, geographical similarity and trophic transfer. We describe the specific ecological insights that can be gained using each overlap metric, in order to determine which is most appropriate for describing spatial predator\textendash prey interactions for different applications. Simulation and case study We use simulated predator and prey distributions to demonstrate how the 10 metrics respond to variation in three types of predator\textendash prey interactions: changing spatial overlap between predator and prey, changing predator population size and changing patterns of predator aggregation in response to prey density. We also apply these overlap metrics to a case study of a predatory fish (arrowtooth flounder, Atheresthes stomias) and its prey (juvenile walleye pollock, Gadus chalcogrammus) in the Eastern Bering Sea, AK, USA. We show how the metrics can be applied to understand spatial and temporal variation in the overlap of species distributions in this rapidly changing Arctic ecosystem. Conclusions Using both simulated and empirical data, we provide a roadmap for ecologists and other practitioners to select overlap metrics to describe particular aspects of spatial predator\textendash prey interactions. We outline a range of research and management applications for which each metric may be suited.},

  abstract = {Ecological theory and experiments indicate that warming can increase the relative strength of top-down effects via alterations to metabolic rates in several different systems, thereby resulting in decreased plant biomass at higher temperatures. However, the general influence of increased environmental temperature on top-down effects is not well understood in systems where organisms experience relatively large variation in temperature. Rapid ocean temperature changes are pervasive throughout the Galapagos Islands due to upwelling and downwelling of internal waves, ENSO events and seasonality. We measured the effect of large, but not uncommon, water temperature variation on the metabolism and grazing rate of a common subtidal herbivore and on photosynthesis of their algal prey in the Galapagos Islands in July 2012. We found that green urchin consumption and metabolism were greater at the higher temperature treatment (28 degrees C), resulting in significantly less algal biomass. Our result that warming increased green urchin metabolic rates, even in a highly dynamic system, provides further support for a mechanistic link between environmental temperature and feeding rates. And further, our findings suggest individual response to temperature results in changes in top-down effects. And if this response is maintained over longer-time scales of days to weeks, this could translate to alterations of larger-scale ecological patterns, such as primary producer community composition and structure.},

  abstract = {Deoxygenation is a global problem in coastal and open regions of the ocean, and has led to expanding areas of oxygen minimum zones and coastal hypoxia. The recent expansion of hypoxia in coastal ecosystems has been primarily attributed to global warming and enhanced nutrient input from land and atmosphere. The largest anthropogenically induced hypoxic area in the world is the Baltic Sea, where the relative importance of physical forcing versus eutrophication is still debated. We have analyzed water column oxygen and salinity profiles to reconstruct oxygen and stratification conditions over the last 115 y and compare the influence of both climate and anthropogenic forcing on hypoxia. We report a 10-fold increase of hypoxia in the Baltic Sea and show that this is primarily linked to increased inputs of nutrients from land, although increased respiration from higher temperatures during the last two decades has contributed to worsening oxygen conditions. Although shifts in climate and physical circulation are important factors modulating the extent of hypoxia, further nutrient reductions in the Baltic Sea will be necessary to reduce the ecosystems impacts of deoxygenation.},

  abstract = {Spatio-temporal density-dependent processes are crucial regulatory factors for natural populations. However, there is a lack of studies addressing spatial density-dependence in fish growth. A previous investigation has suggested spatio-temporal density-dependence in body condition of Baltic sprat. Here, we used different techniques, such as centre of gravity, distance, and homogeneity indices, to better characterize the spatial and temporal variations in sprat density and body condition in the Baltic Proper. Our results evidenced a negative spatio-temporal co-variation between the centres of gravity of density and maximum condition. In the 1980s-early 1990s both centres were located in the middle of the Baltic Proper. From the mid 1990s the centres progressively separated in space, as the sprat population moved towards the north-eastern Baltic Proper, and the centre of maximum condition towards the south-western areas. Moreover, at low abundances, sprat density and condition were homogeneously distributed in space, whereas at high abundances both density and condition showed pronounced geographical gradients. The ecological processes potentially explaining the observed patterns were discussed in the light of the Ideal Free Distribution theory. We provide evidence that the shift in the spatial distribution of cod, the main predator of sprat, has been the main factor triggering the overall spatial changes in sprat density, and thus condition, during the past thirty years. The spatial indices shown here, synthesizing the spatio-temporal patterns of fish distribution, can support the implementation of the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive.},

The body condition of cod (Gadus morhua) in the Baltic Sea has dramatically decreased during the past two decades, with large implications for the fishery relying on this resource. Here, we statistically investigated the potential drivers of the Baltic cod condition during the past 40 years using newly compiled fishery-independent biological data and hydrological observations. We evidenced a combination of different factors operating before and after the ecological regime shift that occurred in the Baltic Sea in the early 1990s. The changes in cod condition related to feeding opportunities, driven either by density-dependence or food limitation, along the whole period investigated and to the fivefold increase in the extent of hypoxic areas in the most recent 20 years. Hypoxic areas can act on cod condition through different mechanisms related directly to species physiology, or indirectly to behaviour and trophic interactions. Our analyses found statistical evidence for an effect of the hypoxia-induced habitat compression on cod condition possibly operating via crowding and density-dependent processes. These results furnish novel insights into the population dynamics of Baltic Sea cod that can aid the management of this currently threatened population.},

  abstract = {The Baltic Sea ecosystem has undergone large changes during the last two decades, including a severe reduction in cod and herring biomass but, at the same time, a large increase in sprat abundance. The lower trophic levels of the Baltic Sea also changed due to environmental fluctuations, including variations in salinity and in volume of oxygenated water. In this apparently shifting environment, the conditions of herring and sprat have undergone large inter-annual variations during the past 15\textendash 20 years. In this study, we explore how abiotic factors (i.e. salinity and temperature) and biotic factors (biomass of the copepods Pseudocalanus elongatus, Temora longicornis, Acartia spp. and of cladocerans as well as clupeid abundance) in different seasons (May and August) affect clupeid body condition. Our analyses suggest that data of zooplankton biomass and abiotic factors in August have higher predictive power than May data. Although our analysis suggests that salinity (a bottom-up process) has an effect on sprat condition, total abundance of clupeids (a top-down process) is by far the most significant predictor of both herring and sprat condition. The strong correlation between clupeid abundance and total zooplankton biomass points to food competition and to top-down control by herring and sprat on common food resources. Furthermore, clupeid condition co-varied with the changes in the weight of zooplankton in the stomachs, which further suggest food competition being the main mechanism behind the changes in clupeid condition during the last two decades. Hence, our results are not in agreement with most of the current literature that has suggested that clupeid growth is regulated by environmentally mediated bottom-up processes acting on the abundance of copepods. This is, to our knowledge, the first evidence of food resources mediated density-dependent fish growth in a large marine ecosystem.},

So far it has been difficult to demonstrate multi-level trophic cascades in pelagic marine environments. Using field data collected during a 33-year period, we show for the first time a four-level community-wide trophic cascade in the open Baltic Sea. The dramatic reduction of the cod (Gadus morhua) population directly affected its main prey, the zooplanktivorous sprat (Sprattus sprattus), and indirectly the summer biomass of zooplankton and phytoplankton (top-down processes). Bottom-up processes and climate-hydrological forces had a weaker influence on sprat and zooplankton, whereas phytoplankton variation was explained solely by top-down mechanisms. Our results suggest that in order to dampen the occasionally harmful algal blooms of the Baltic, effort should be addressed not only to control anthropogenic nutrient inputs but also to preserve structure and functioning of higher trophic levels.},

Source-sink dynamics and spillover processes may link adjacent ecosystems by movement of organisms across system boundaries.

Here we show, using 35 y of multitrophic data series from the Baltic Sea, that transitory spillover of the top-predator cod from its main distribution area produces cascading effects in the whole food web of an adjacent and semi-isolated ecosystem. At varying population size, cod expand/contract their distribution range and invade/retreat from the neighboring Gulf of Riga, thereby affecting the local prey population of herring and, indirectly, zooplankton and phytoplankton via top-down control. The Gulf of Riga can be considered for cod a "true sink" habitat, where in the absence of immigration from the source areas of the central Baltic Sea the cod population goes extinct due to the absence of suitable spawning grounds. Our results add a metaecosystem perspective to the ongoing intense scientific debate on the key role of top predators in structuring natural systems. The integration of regional and local processes is central to predict species and ecosystem responses to future climate changes and ongoing anthropogenic disturbances.},

Fish were sampled once a year during the period 2010\textendash 2012, in 32 sampling sites, and for each specimen individual body condition factor was estimated. A negative significant correlation was found between condition factor and pressures related to alteration of the hydrographic regime, while a significant positive correlation was found with trophic status indicators and fishery activities.

  abstract = {Multivariate autoregressive (MAR) models are an increasingly popular technique to infer interaction strengths between species in a community and to predict the community response to environmental change. The most commonly employed MAR(1) models, with one time lag, can be viewed either as multispecies competition models with Gompertz density dependence or, more generally, as a linear approximation of more complex, nonlinear dynamics around stable equilibria. This latter interpretation allows for broader applicability, but may come at a cost in terms of interpretation of estimates and reliability of both short- and long-term predictions. We investigate what these costs might be by fitting MAR(1) models to simulated 2-species competition, consumer-resource and host\textendash parasitoid systems, as well as a larger food web influenced by the environment. We review how MAR(1) coefficients can be interpreted and evaluate how reliable are estimates of interaction strength, rank, or sign; accuracy of short-term forecasts; as well as the ability of MAR(1) models to predict the long-term responses of communities submitted to environmental change such as PRESS perturbations. The net effects of species j on species i are usually (90\%-95\%) well recovered in terms of sign or rank, with the notable exception of overcompensatory dynamics. In actual values, net effects of species j on species i are not well recovered when the underlying dynamics are nonlinear. MAR(1) models are better at making short-term qualitative forecasts (next point going up or down) than at predicting long-term responses to environmental perturbations, which can be severely over- as well as underestimated. We conclude that when applying MAR(1) models to ecological data, inferences on net effects among species should be limited to signs, or the Gompertz assumption should be tested and discussed. This particular assumption on density-dependence (log-linearity) is also required for unbiased long-term predictions. Overall, we think that MAR(1) models are highly useful tools to resolve and characterize community dynamics, but we recommend to use them in conjunction with alternative, nonlinear models resembling the ecological context in order to improve their interpretation in specific applications.},

Here we use laboratory and field data on Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua, to illustrate that many of these responses can be explained within the metabolic scope (MS) framework, i.e. taking into account the directive and limiting effects of dissolved oxygen (DO) on the ability of animals to acquire energy for growth and activity. A MS model for cod shows that scope for activity (swimming, feeding, etc.) is proportional to DO and becomes nil, jeopardising survival, when DO is {$<\approx$}20\% air saturation. Laboratory studies have confirmed this lethal threshold and demonstrated that growth and food ingestion were significantly reduced below 70\% sat. This loss of appetite has been linked to a reduction of the peak value and an increase in duration of postprandial metabolism, in agreement with the MS model. Dwindling MS during hypoxia imposes an upper limit to swimming performance. Cod may also opt to reduce spontaneous swimming activity to spare oxygen for other activities such as digestion. In the Kattegat, the Baltic Sea, and the Gulf of St. Lawrence, eastern Canada, cod completely avoid waters where their MS is near zero. Furthermore, cod density increases exponentially with DO up to {$\approx$}70\% sat in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Although hypoxia results in other direct and indirect effects as well, the MS framework allows modelling of many of the responses to hypoxia for individual cod that ought to be reflected at the population and community levels. The MS framework is also useful to compare species responses. We show that the impact of hypoxia on MS is similar, when expressed as a proportion of MS in normoxia, in cod, European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), the common sole (Solea solea) and turbot (Psetta maxima). Data are required for other species to evaluate how general these findings are.},

Historically a three-parameter von Bertalanffy growth model (VBGM) has most often been used to describe the somatic growth of fish. However, increasingly, populations are identified with patterns of growth that are not adequately described by the standard VBGM. We describe a more flexible growth model obtained by replacing the normally constant von Bertalanffy growth coefficient, k, with a piecewise constant function, K, of age. In principle this allows arbitrary monotonic growth to be approximated within a generalized von Bertalanffy structure. Posterior distributions of model parameters are approximated by the method of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo using the Stan software package. Spline smoothing of the K function is achieved by specifying a hierarchical random walk prior. We compare fits achieved using this new approach to observations of length-at-age of southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii) with a range of existing growth models.},

We used a spatio-temporal bioenergetics model of the Northeast Pacific Ocean to quantify how predation by three species of pinnipeds and killer whales (Orcinus orca) on Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) has changed since the 1970s along the west coast of North America, and compare these estimates to salmon fisheries. We find that from 1975 to 2015, biomass of Chinook salmon consumed by pinnipeds and killer whales increased from 6,100 to 15,200 metric tons (from 5 to 31.5 million individual salmon). Though there is variation across the regions in our model, overall, killer whales consume the largest biomass of Chinook salmon, but harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) consume the largest number of individuals. The decrease in adult Chinook salmon harvest from 1975\textendash 2015 was 16,400 to 9,600 metric tons. Thus, Chinook salmon removals (harvest\,+\,consumption) increased in the past 40 years despite catch reductions by fisheries, due to consumption by recovering pinnipeds and endangered killer whales. Long-term management strategies for Chinook salmon will need to consider potential conflicts between rebounding predators or endangered predators and prey.},

  abstract = {We developed a bioenergetics model for the western mosquitofish Gambusia affinis by combining data on temperature-dependent feeding rates with published information on respiration, temperature tolerance, and reproduction. To corroborate the model, we compared bioenergetics estimates with independent observations from laboratory feeding and growth trials. The model was then applied to a western mosquitofish population in Illinois to estimate feeding rates on natural prey taxa, including mosquito (Culicidae) larvae. Laboratory feeding experiments revealed that western mosquitofish have a high feeding capacity. Maximum consumption rates were 0.25\textendash 1.06 g{$\cdot$}gϪ1{$\cdot$}dϪ1 at water temperatures between 5\cyrchar\CYRNJE C and 40\cyrchar\CYRNJE C; the highest feeding rates were observed at 32\cyrchar\CYRNJE C. Bioenergetics estimates of food consumption agreed well with laboratory measurements across a wide range of water temperatures (10\textendash 35\cyrchar\CYRNJE C). However, for fish experiencing negligible growth, model estimates of food consumption were higher than actual values measured in the laboratory. We postulate that at very low feeding and growth rates, activity costs may be overestimated by the model. Field-derived bioenergetics estimates of total food consumption ranged from 0.18 to 0.31 g of dry weight and were similar to those obtained from an empirical model relating western mosquitofish feeding and growth rates (0.15\textendash 0.39 g dry weight). Based on model simulations, we estimated that a typical age-0 western mosquitofish consumed about 1,990 mosquito larvae (2\textendash 68 larvae/d) from August 22 to October 8, 1998. Because the diets of free-ranging western mosquitofish were diverse, field-based estimates of mosquito consumption were generally lower than those reported for laboratory experiments, in which fish were fed only mosquito larvae. By accounting for diet composition in free-ranging western mosquitofish, the bioenergetics approach provides more realistic estimates of mosquito consumption than laboratory feeding experiments. Given recent concerns over the spread of West Nile virus, the model developed here should prove useful for quantifying western mosquitofish consumption in the context of both mosquito control and potential impacts on nontarget organisms.},

  abstract = {The present study determined the effect of body mass and acclimation temperature (15\textendash 28 C) on oxygen consumption rate (\.MO2) and the size dependency of preferred temperature in European perch Perca fluviatilis. Standard metabolic rate (SMR) scaled allometrically with body mass by an exponent of 0.86, and temperature influenced SMR with a Q10 of 1.9 regardless of size. Maximum metabolic rate (MMR) and aerobic scope (MMR-SMR) scaled allometrically with body mass by exponents of 0.75\textendash 0.88. The mass scaling exponents of MMR and aerobic scope changed with temperature and were lowest at the highest temperature. Consequently, the optimal temperature for aerobic scope decreased with increasing body mass. Notably, fish {$<$}40 g did not show a decrease aerobic scope with increasing temperature. Factorial aerobic scope (MMR \texttimes{} SMR-1) generally decreased with increasing temperatures, was unaffected by size at the lower temperatures, and scaled negatively with body mass at the highest temperature. Similar to the optimal temperature for aerobic scope, preferred temperature declined with increasing body mass, unaffectedly by acclimation temperature. The present study indicates a limitation in the capacity for oxygen uptake in larger fish at high temperatures. A constraint in oxygen uptake at high temperature may restrict the growth of larger fish with environmental warming, at least if food availability is not limited. Furthermore, behavioural thermoregulation may be contributing to regional changes in the size distribution of fish in the wild caused by global warming as larger individuals will prefer colder water at higher latitudes and at larger depths than smaller conspecifics with increasing environmental temperatures.},

Trophic amplification (or attenuation) describe the propagation of a hydroclimatic signal up the food web, causing magnification (or depression) of biomass values along one or more trophic pathways. We have employed 3-D coupled physical-biogeochemical models to explore ecosystem responses to climate change with a focus on trophic amplification. The response of phytoplankton and zooplankton to global climate-change projections, carried out with the IPSL Earth System Model by the end of the century, is analysed at global and regional basis, including European seas (NE Atlantic, Barents Sea, Baltic Sea, Black Sea, Bay of Biscay, Adriatic Sea, Aegean Sea) and the Eastern Boundary Upwelling System (Benguela). Results indicate that globally and in Atlantic Margin and North Sea, increased ocean stratification causes primary production and zooplankton biomass to decrease in response to a warming climate, whilst in the Barents, Baltic and Black Seas, primary production and zooplankton biomass increase. Projected warming characterized by an increase in sea surface temperature of 2.29 +/- 0.05 degrees C leads to a reduction in zooplankton and phytoplankton biomasses of 11\% and 6\%, respectively. This suggests negative amplification of climate driven modifications of trophic level biomass through bottom-up control, leading to a reduced capacity of oceans to regulate climate through the biological carbon pump. Simulations suggest negative amplification is the dominant response across 47\% of the ocean surface and prevails in the tropical oceans; whilst positive trophic amplification prevails in the Arctic and Antarctic oceans. Trophic attenuation is projected in temperate seas. Uncertainties in ocean plankton projections, associated to the use of single global and regional models, imply the need for caution when extending these considerations into higher trophic levels.},

Results indicate that when population biomass was beyond a threshold a further increase in biomass-promoted habitat expansion in a non-additive fashion with water temperature. In contrast, during years of low population size, habitat occupancy was affected positively only by water temperature. These results reveal the spatial signature of intraspecific abundance distribution relationships as well as the non-additive and non-stationary responses of species spatial dynamics. Furthermore, these results underscore the importance of implementing analytical techniques that can simultaneously account for density-dependent and density-independent sources of variability when studying geographical distribution patterns.},

Limited knowledge of when spatial constraints are most likely to occur in marine fish life cycles has impeded the development of realistic distribution forecasts. In this study, we develop and implement analytical techniques to identify spatial constraints, defined by both the consistency through which a particular geographic area is used year after year, and by the extent of such area with respect to the entire population range. This approach is applied to simulated data and to ten case-studies including six groundfish species from three subarctic marine systems. Our analyses illustrate that the early phase of the species' life cycle is more spatially constrained than older life stages. We detected significant species-specific variability in both the degree to which species are anchored in space throughout their life cycle, and the ontogenetic changes in the geographic association. There is an indication that this variability can be explained by the species life history strategy, highlighting the need to extend similar analyses to other species and regions. The presence of ontogenetic spatial constraints, particularly during early life stages, indicates restrictions exist to changes in spatial distribution and questions the assertion that global warming will uniformly result in an increase in abundance and harvest at higher latitudes and decreases at lower latitudes. Our study develops ecological and analytical insights that are critical for accurate projections of species distributions under different climate change scenarios.},

  abstract = {By numerical continuation of equilibria, we study a size-structured model for the dynamics of a cannibalistic fish population and its alternative resource. Because we model the cannibalistic interaction as dependent on the ratio of cannibal length and victim length, a cannibal experiences a size distribution of potential victims which depends on its own body size. We show how equilibria of the resulting infinite-dimensional dynamical system can be traced with an existing method for numerical continuation for physiologically structured population models. With this approach we found that cannibalism can induce bistability associated with a fold (or, saddle-node) bifurcation. The two stable states can be qualified as `stunted' and `piscivorous', respectively. We identify a new ecological mechanism for bistability, in which the energy gain from cannibalism plays a crucial role: Whereas in the stunted population state cannibals consume their victims, on average, while they are very small and yield little energy, in the piscivorous state cannibals consume their victims not before they have become much bigger, which results in a much higher mean yield of cannibalism. We refer to this mechanism as the `Hansel and Gretel' effect. It is not related to any individual `choice' or `strategy', but depends purely on a difference in population size distribution. We argue that studying dynamics of size-structured population models with this new approach of equilibrium continuation extends the insight that can be gleaned from numerical simulations of the model dynamics.},

  abstract = {Cannibals and their victims often share common resources and thus potentially compete. Smaller individuals are often competitively superior to larger ones because of size-dependent scaling of foraging and metabolic rates, while larger ones may use cannibalism to counter this competition. We study the interplay between cannibalism and competition using a size-structured population model in which all individuals consume a shared resource but in which larger ones may cannibalize smaller conspecifics. In this model, intercohort competition causes single-cohort cycles when cannibalism is absent. Moderate levels of cannibalism reduce intercohort competition, enabling coexistence of many cohorts. More voracious cannibalism, in combination with competition, produces large-amplitude cycles and a bimodal population size distribution with many small and few giant individuals. These coexisting "dwarfs" and "giants" have very different life histories, resulting from a reversal in importance of cannibalism and competition. The population structure at time of birth determines whether individuals suffer severe cannibalism, with the few survivors reaching giant sizes, or whether they suffer intense intracohort competition, with all individuals remaining small. These model results agree remarkably well with empirical data on perch population dynamics. We argue that the induction of cannibalistic giants in piscivorous fish is a population-dynamic emergent phenomenon that requires a combination of size-dependent cannibalism and competition.},

  abstract = {In size-structured predator\textendash prey systems, capture success depends on the sizes of both predator and prey. We study the population-dynamic consequences of sizedependent predation using a model of a size-structured, cannibalistic fish population with one shared, alternative resource. We assume that a prey can be captured by a predator if the ratio of prey length to predator length is within a specific range, referred to as the ``predation window.'' We find that the lower limit of the predation window (?) has a major impact on population dynamics, whereas the upper limit (␧) mainly affects population structure and individual life history. For large ?, cannibalism cannot decimate young-ofyear (YOY) cohorts. Size-dependent competition then results in recruit-driven, single-cohort cycles. With low ?, cannibalism regulates recruitment, resulting in coexistence of many year classes. With intermediate ?, periods of regulation by cannibalism alternate with periods with severe competition. Occasional high densities of small individuals enable a few cannibals to reach giant sizes, producing a bimodal population size distribution. With small ␧, all individuals remain small; the population is stunted. Large piscivores can exist only if induced dynamically in population fluctuations. Above a critical ␧, large piscivores are present permanently, even in stable populations. The critical effect of ␧ relates to the ontogenetic niche shift from planktivory to piscivory. Observed population dynamics of Eurasian perch, yellow perch, and Arctic char, described in the literature, are discussed and, based on our modeling results, can be related to differences in the predation windows of these species. We argue that the effects of ? and ␧ relate to two fundamentally different and mutually exclusive aspects of cannibalism.},

Limiting oxygen concentration curves (O2 level ranging between 15 and 100\% air saturation) were established at 2, 5 and 10\textdegree C. The standard metabolic rate (SMR), the maximum metabolic rate and the metabolic scope were then modelled as functions of temperature and/or oxygen saturation. The mean SMR at 2, 5 and 10\textdegree C were 19.8{$\pm$}4.9, 30.8{$\pm$}6.1 and 54.3{$\pm$}4.1mg O2h-1kg-1, respectively. Between 2 and 5\textdegree C, the active metabolic rate of cod almost doubled from 65 to 120mg O2h-1kg-1, to reach 177mg O2h-1kg-1 at 10\textdegree C. In terms of metabolic scope (MS), the temperature rise from 2 to 5\textdegree C resulted in a two-fold increase from 45 to 89mg O2h-1kg-1, with MS reaching 123mg O2h-1kg-1 at 10\textdegree C. Our proposed model describing the impact of temperature and oxygen level provides new insight into the energetic interactions which govern the relationship between Atlantic cod and its environment. We re-examined published experimental and field studies from the angle of the regulation of metabolic power. We suggest that, when faced with heterogeneous or unstable hydrological conditions, cod tend to behaviourally maximise their metabolic scope. Through this adaptive response, fish reduce energy budgeting conflicts and presumably increase the probability of routinely operating away from lethal boundaries.},

  abstract = {Generalised additive models (GAMs) are increasingly popular tools for estimating smooth nonlinear relationships between predictors and response variables. GAMs are particularly relevant in ecology for representing hierarchical functions for discrete responses that encompass complex features including zero inflation, truncation and uneven sampling. However, GAMs are less useful for producing forecasts as their smooth functions provide unstable predictions outside the range of training data. We introduce dynamic generalised additive models (DGAMs), where the GAM linear predictor is jointly estimated with unobserved dynamic components to model time series that evolve as a function of nonlinear predictor associations and latent temporal processes. These models are especially useful for analysing multiple series, as they can estimate hierarchical smooth functions while learning complex temporal associations via dimension-reduced latent factor processes. We implement our models in the mvgam R package, which estimates unobserved parameters for smoothing splines and latent temporal processes in a probabilistic framework. Using simulations, we illustrate how our models outperform competing formulations in realistic ecological forecasting tasks while identifying important smooth predictor functions. We use a real-world case study to highlight some of mvgam's key features, which include functions for calculating correlations among series' latent trends, performing model selection using rolling window forecasts and posterior predictive checks, online data augmentation via a recursive particle filter and visualising probabilistic uncertainties for smooth functions and predictions. Dynamic GAMs (DGAMs) offer a solution to the challenge of forecasting discrete time series while estimating ecologically relevant nonlinear predictor associations. Our Bayesian latent factor approach will be particularly useful for exploring competing dynamic ecological models that encompass hierarchical smoothing structures while providing forecasts with robust uncertainties, tasks that are becoming increasingly important in applied ecology.},

  abstract = {Ocean warming and deoxygenation are affecting the physiological performance of marine species by increasing their oxygen demand while reducing oxygen supply. Impacts on organisms (e.g., growth and reproduction) can eventually affect entire populations, altering macroecological dynamics and shifting species' distribution ranges. To quantify the effect of warming and deoxygenation on marine organisms, Penn et al., 2018, Deutsch et al., 2020 developed two metabolic indices that integrate physiological, biogeographic and climatic data. Here, we develop an alternative index, referred to as Aerobic Growth Index (AGI) based on an approach that integrates the von Bertalanffy growth theory and metabolic theory. We compare the results derived from the application of AGI with those of the two previously published metabolic indices for six species: Atlantic blue crab (Callinectes sapidus), Sharpsnout seabream (Diplodus puntazzo), Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), Australian spiny lobster (Panulirus cygnus), Red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) and common cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis). The baseline (1971-2000) habitat suitability values of AGI are significantly and positively correlated with both metabolic indices (R2 {$\geq$} 0.96). All three indices also show similar spatial patterns and magnitudes of viable habitat loss by the end of the 21st century (2071-2100) relative to baseline conditions under a high greenhouse gas concentration trajectory (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5). Our results support the applicability and use of AGI to better understand the impacts of warming and deoxygenation on global marine fishery resources. Given the uncertainties surrounding mechanisms linking temperature, oxygen and biogeography, there is a need for different indicators to account for these uncertainties in climate change projections.},

  abstract = {1. We present a statistical analysis of the scaling of resting (basal) metabolic rate, BMR, with body mass, B(m) and body temperature, T(b), in mammals. 2. Whilst the majority of the variance in ln BMR is explained by ln B(m), the T(b) term is statistically significant. The best fit model was quadratic, indicating that the scaling of ln BMR with ln B(m) varies with body size; the value of any scaling exponent estimated for a sample of mammals will therefore depend on the size distribution of species in the study. This effect can account for much of the variation in scaling exponents reported in the literature for mammals. 3. In all models, inclusion of T(b) reduced the strength of scaling with ln B(m). The model including T(b) suggests that birds and mammals have a similar underlying thermal dependence of BMR, equivalent to a Q(10) of 2.9 across the range of T(b) values 32-42 degrees C. 4. There was significant heterogeneity in both the mass scaling exponent and mean BMR across mammalian orders, with a tendency for orders dominated by larger taxa to have steeper scaling exponents. This heterogeneity was particularly marked across orders with smaller mean B(m) and the taxonomic composition of the sample will thus also affect the observed scaling exponent. After correcting for the effects of ln B(m) and T(b), Soricomorpha, Didelphimorphia and Artiodactyla had the highest BMR of those orders represented by more than 10 species in the data set. 5. Inclusion of T(b) in the model removed the effect of diet category evident from a model in ln B(m) alone and widely reported in the literature; this was caused by a strong interaction between diet category and T(b) in mammals. 6. Inclusion of mean ambient temperature, T(a), in the model indicated a significant inverse relationship between ln BMR and T(a), complicated by an interaction between T(a) and T(b). All other things being equal, a polar mammal living at -10 degrees C has a body temperature approximately 2.7 degrees C warmer and a BMR higher by approximately 40\% than a tropical mammal of similar size living at 25 degrees C.},

For example, hypothesised differences between species do not operate at the species level, but concern individuals responding to environmental variation, including competition with neighbours. Aggregated data from many individuals subject to spatio-temporal variation are used to produce species-level averages, which marginalise away the relevant (process-level) scale. Paradoxically, the higher the dimensionality, the more ways there are to differ, yet the more species appear the same. The aggregate becomes increasingly irrelevant and misleading. Standard analyses can make species look the same, reverse species rankings along niche axes, make the surprising prediction that a species decreases in abundance when a competitor is removed from a model, or simply preclude parameter estimation. Aggregation explains why niche differences hidden at the species level become apparent upon disaggregation to the individual level, why models suggest that individual-level variation has a minor impact on diversity when disaggregation shows it to be important, and why literature-based synthesis can be unfruitful. We show how to identify when aggregation is the problem, where it has caused controversy, and propose three ways to address it.},

  abstract = {16 Community ecology is often perceived as a mess given the seemingly vast number of processes 17 that can underlie the many patterns of interest, and the apparent uniqueness of each study 18 system. However, at the most general level, patterns in the composition and diversity of species 19 (the subject matter of community ecology) are influenced by only four classes of process: 20 selection, drift, speciation, and dispersal. Selection represents deterministic fitness differences 21 among species; drift represents stochastic changes in species abundance; speciation creates new 22 species; and dispersal is the movement of organisms across space. All theoretical and 23 conceptual models in community ecology can be understood with respect to their emphasis on 24 these four processes. Empirical evidence exists for all four and many of their interactions, with 25 a predominance of studies on selection. Organizing the material of community ecology 26 according to this framework can clarify the essential similarities and differences among the 27 many conceptual and theoretical approaches to the discipline, and can allow articulation of a 28 very general theory of community dynamics: Species are added to communities via speciation 29 and dispersal, and these species' relative abundances are then shaped by drift and selection, as 30 well as ongoing dispersal, to drive community dynamics. 31 32 INTRODUCTION 33 Community ecology is the study of patterns in the diversity, abundance, and composition of 34 species in communities, and the processes underlying these patterns. It is a difficult subject to 35 grasp in its entirety, with the patterns of interest seemingly contingent on every last detail of 36 environment and species interactions, and an unsettling morass of theoretical models that take 37 wide variety of forms. Fifteen years ago, Palmer (1994) identified 120 different hypotheses to 38 explain the maintenance of species diversity, and the list would no doubt be longer today. 39 However, despite the overwhelmingly large number of mechanisms thought to underpin patterns 40 in ecological communities, all such mechanisms involve only four distinct kinds of process: 41 selection, drift, speciation, and dispersal. 42 Many biologists will recognize these four processes as close analogues of the " big four " 43 in population genetics: selection, drift, mutation, and gene flow. Many ecologists, however, 44 might be skeptical that such a simple organizational scheme is applicable to the more complex 45 subject of community ecology.

  abstract = {Condition indices are used in fishery science as indicators of the weight-to-length relationship of a population or subgroup (e.g., strain, sex, or age category). This conversion of the two-dimensional weight-length relationship into a single statistic results in a loss of information and, in many cases, an inaccurate representation of that relationship. Fulton{$\Elzverts$}s condition factor (K) is based on the assumption that the slope of the weight-length relationship is 3.0. The relative condition factor (Kn) is based on the assumption that the slopes of all samples to be compared are equal to some specific value. Relative weight (Wr) is based on the assumption that the slope and the intercept of the weight-length relationship are the same as those in the ``ideal'' equation. Instead of providing simple, interpretable descriptions of the weight-length relationship in fish populations, all three of these commonly used condition indices have critical flaws that can result in incorrect conclusions. Relative weight is arguably the most misleading of these indices, and its use should be reconsidered before it becomes as misused as Fulton{$\Elzverts$}s K. The calculation of estimates of ordinary least-squares regression parameters is a more accurate method of examining the weight-length relationships for fish populations, and I suggest that it is the preferred method for evaluation of fish condition.},

We conducted an integrated assessment of global production data from crop, livestock, aquaculture and fisheries sectors over 53\,years to understand how shocks occurring in one food sector can create diverse and linked challenges among others. We show that some regions are shock hotspots, exposed frequently to shocks across multiple sectors. Critically, shock frequency has increased through time on land and sea at a global scale. Geopolitical and extreme-weather events were the main shock drivers identified, but with considerable differences across sectors. We illustrate how social and ecological drivers, influenced by the dynamics of the food system, can spill over multiple food sectors and create synchronous challenges or trade-offs among terrestrial and aquatic systems. In a more shock-prone and interconnected world, bold food policy and social protection mechanisms that help people anticipate, cope with and recover from losses will be central to sustainability.},

Recent evidence suggests that the growth of this population may be limited by food resources, especially Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). We present spatio-temporal bioenergetics model for SRKW in the Salish Sea and the West Coast of Vancouver Island from 1979\textendash 2020 with the objective of evaluating how changes in the abundance, age-structure, and length-at-age of Chinook salmon populations has influenced the daily food consumption of the SRKW population. Our model showed that the SRKW population has been in energetic deficit for six of the last 40 years. Our results also suggested that the abundance of age-4 and age-5 Chinook salmon are significant predictors of energy intake for SRKW. We estimated that the annual consumption (April-October) of Chinook salmon by the whales between 1979 and 2020 ranged from 166,000 216,300. Over the past 40 years, the model estimated that the contribution in the predicted SRKW diet of Chinook salmon originating from the Columbia River has increased by about 34\%, and decreased by about 15\% for Chinook salmon stocks originating from Puget Sound. Overall, our study provides an overview of the requirements and availability of prey for SRKW over the last 40 years, while supporting the hypothesis that SRKW were limited by prey abundance in the study period.},

  abstract = {Winner of the 2013 DeGroot Prize.  A state-of-the-art presentation of spatio-temporal processes, bridging classic ideas with modern hierarchical statistical modeling concepts and the latest computational methods Noel Cressie and Christopher K. Wikle, are also winners of the 2011 PROSE Award in the Mathematics category, for the book ``Statistics for Spatio-Temporal Data'' (2011), published by John Wiley and Sons. (The PROSE awards, for Professional and Scholarly Excellence, are given by the Association of American Publishers, the national trade association of the US book publishing industry.) Statistics for Spatio-Temporal Data has now been reprinted with small corrections to the text and the bibliography. The overall content and pagination of the new printing remains the same; the difference comes in the form of corrections to typographical errors, editing of incomplete and missing references, and some updated spatio-temporal interpretations. From understanding environmental processes and climate trends to developing new technologies for mapping public-health data and the spread of invasive-species, there is a high demand for statistical analyses of data that take spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal information into account. Statistics for Spatio-Temporal Data presents a systematic approach to key quantitative techniques that incorporate the latest advances in statistical computing as well as hierarchical, particularly Bayesian, statistical modeling, with an emphasis on dynamical spatio-temporal models. Cressie and Wikle supply a unique presentation that incorporates ideas from the areas of time series and spatial statistics as well as stochastic processes. Beginning with separate treatments of temporal data and spatial data, the book combines these concepts to discuss spatio-temporal statistical methods for understanding complex processes. Topics of coverage include:  Exploratory methods for spatio-temporal data, including visualization, spectral analysis, empirical orthogonal function analysis, and LISAs Spatio-temporal covariance functions, spatio-temporal kriging, and time series of spatial processes Development of hierarchical dynamical spatio-temporal models (DSTMs), with discussion of linear and nonlinear DSTMs and computational algorithms for their implementation Quantifying and exploring spatio-temporal variability in scientific applications, including case studies based on real-world environmental data  Throughout the book, interesting applications demonstrate the relevance of the presented concepts. Vivid, full-color graphics emphasize the visual nature of the topic, and a related FTP site contains supplementary material. Statistics for Spatio-Temporal Data is an excellent book for a graduate-level course on spatio-temporal statistics. It is also a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners in the fields of applied mathematics, engineering, and the environmental and health sciences.},

Parameters were estimated for channel catfish. Fish growth was more sensitive to changes in food consumption parameters than to changes in metabolic parameters. Within either the food consumption component or the metabolic component, fish growth was more sensitive to changes in temperature parameters than to changes in parameters for body size, dissolved oxygen or unionized ammonia. The model may be reparameterized to represent different species of fish in different environments and provides a common ground for theoretical, laboratory and field studies.

  abstract = {Most ecosystem functions and related services involve species interactions across trophic levels, for example, pollination and biological pest control. Despite this, our understanding of ecosystem function in multitrophic communities is poor, and research has been limited to either manipulation in small communities or statistical descriptions in larger ones. Recent advances in food web ecology may allow us to overcome the trade-off between mechanistic insight and ecological realism. Molecular tools now simplify the detection of feeding interactions, and trait-based approaches allow the application of dynamic food web models to real ecosystems. We performed the first test of an allometric food web model's ability to replicate temporally nonaggregated abundance data from the field and to provide mechanistic insight into the function of predation. We aimed to reproduce and explore the drivers of the population dynamics of the aphid herbivore Rhopalosiphum padi observed in ten Swedish barley fields. We used a dynamic food web model, taking observed interactions and abundances of predators and alternative prey as input data, allowing us to examine the role of predation in aphid population control. The inverse problem methods were used for simultaneous model fit optimization and model parameterization. The model captured {$>$}70\% of the variation in aphid abundance in five of ten fields, supporting the model-embodied hypothesis that body size can be an important determinant of predation in the arthropod community. We further demonstrate how in-depth model analysis can disentangle the likely drivers of function, such as the community's abundance and trait composition. Analysing the variability in model performance revealed knowledge gaps, such as the source of episodic aphid mortality, and general method development needs that, if addressed, would further increase model success and enable stronger inference about ecosystem function. The results demonstrate that confronting dynamic food web models with abundance data from the field is a viable approach to evaluate ecological theory and to aid our understanding of function in real ecosystems. However, to realize the full potential of food web models, in ecosystem function research and beyond, trait-based parameterization must be refined and extended to include more traits than body size.},

  abstract = {Some cope better than others Increasingly, research is revealing how organisms may, or may not, adapt to a changing climate. Understanding the limitations placed by a species's physiology can help to determine whether it has an immediate potential to deal with rapid change. Many studies have looked at physiological tolerance to climate change in fishes, with results indicating a range of responses. Dahlke et al. conducted a meta-analysis to explore how life stage may influence a species's ability to tolerate temperature change (see the Perspective by Sunday). They found that embryos and breeding adult fishes are much more susceptible to temperature change than those in other life stages and that this factor must therefore be considered in evaluations of susceptibility. Science, this issue p. 65; see also p. 35 Species' vulnerability to climate change depends on the most temperature-sensitive life stages, but for major animal groups such as fish, life cycle bottlenecks are often not clearly defined. We used observational, experimental, and phylogenetic data to assess stage-specific thermal tolerance metrics for 694 marine and freshwater fish species from all climate zones. Our analysis shows that spawning adults and embryos consistently have narrower tolerance ranges than larvae and nonreproductive adults and are most vulnerable to climate warming. The sequence of stage-specific thermal tolerance corresponds with the oxygen-limitation hypothesis, suggesting a mechanistic link between ontogenetic changes in cardiorespiratory (aerobic) capacity and tolerance to temperature extremes. A logarithmic inverse correlation between the temperature dependence of physiological rates (development and oxygen consumption) and thermal tolerance range is proposed to reflect a fundamental, energetic trade-off in thermal adaptation. Scenario-based climate projections considering the most critical life stages (spawners and embryos) clearly identify the temperature requirements for reproduction as a critical bottleneck in the life cycle of fish. By 2100, depending on the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenario followed, the percentages of species potentially affected by water temperatures exceeding their tolerance limit for reproduction range from \textasciitilde 10\% (SSP 1\textendash 1.9) to \textasciitilde 60\% (SSP 5\textendash 8.5). Efforts to meet ambitious climate targets (SSP 1\textendash 1.9) could therefore benefit many fish species and people who depend on healthy fish stocks. Thermal tolerance metrics for 694 marine and freshwater fish species reveal that breeding stages are most vulnerable to climate warming. Thermal tolerance metrics for 694 marine and freshwater fish species reveal that breeding stages are most vulnerable to climate warming.},

  abstract = {Using only spatially and temporally replicated point counts, Royle (2004b, Biometrics 60, 108-115) developed an N-mixture model to estimate the abundance of an animal population when individual animal detection probability is unknown. One assumption inherent in this model is that the animal populations at each sampled location are closed with respect to migration, births, and deaths throughout the study. In the past this has been verified solely by biological arguments related to the study design as no statistical verification was available. In this article, we propose a generalization of the N-mixture model that can be used to formally test the closure assumption. Additionally, when applied to an open metapopulation, the generalized model provides estimates of population dynamics parameters and yields abundance estimates that account for imperfect detection probability and do not require the closure assumption. A simulation study shows these abundance estimates are less biased than the abundance estimate obtained from the original N-mixture model. The proposed model is then applied to two data sets of avian point counts. The first example demonstrates the closure test on a single-season study of Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), and the second uses the proposed model to estimate the population dynamics parameters and yearly abundance of American robins (Turdus migratorius) from a multi-year study.},

  abstract = {The recent advent of dynamic size spectrum models has allowed the analysis of life processes in marine ecosystems to be carried out without the high complexity arising from interspecies interactions within dense food webs. In this paper, we use ``mizer'', a size spectrum modelling framework, to investigate the consequences of including the seasonal processes of plankton blooms and batch spawning in the model dynamics. A multispecies size spectrum model is constructed using 12 common North Sea fish species, with growth, predation, and mortality explicitly modelled, before simulating both seasonal plankton blooms and batch spawning of fish (using empirical data on the spawning patterns of each species). The effect of seasonality on the community size spectrum is investigated; it is found that with seasonal processes included, the species spectra are more varied over time, while the aggregated community spectrum remains fairly similar. Growth of seasonally spawning mature individuals drops significantly during peak reproduction, although lifetime growth curves follow nonseasonal ones closely. On analysing properties of the community spectrum under different fishing scenarios, seasonality generally causes more varied spectrum slopes and lower yields. Under seasonal conditions, increasing fishing effort also results in greater temporal variability of fisheries yields due to truncation of the community spectrum towards smaller sizes. Further work is needed to evaluate robustness of management strategies in the context of a wider range of seasonal processes and behavioural strategies, as well as longer term environmental variability and change. \textcopyright{} 2016 Published by NRC Research Press.

These projections are critically needed to develop strategies for resource management and the conservation of marine ecosystems. SDMs are a powerful and necessary tool; however, they are subject to many sources of uncertainty. To ensure that SDM projections are informative for management and conservation decisions, sources of uncertainty must be considered and properly addressed. Here we provide ten overarching guidelines that will aid researchers to identify, minimize, and account for uncertainty through the entire model development process, from the formation of a study question to the presentation of results. These guidelines were developed at an international workshop attended by over 50 researchers and practitioners. Although our guidelines are broadly applicable across biological realms, we provide particular focus to the challenges and uncertainties associated with projecting the impacts of climate change on marine species and ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Environmental temperature has systematic effects on rates of species interactions, primarily through its influence on organismal physiology. We present a mechanistic model for the thermal response of consumer-resource interactions. We focus on how temperature affects species interactions via key traits - body velocity, detection distance, search rate and handling time - that underlie per capita consumption rate. The model is general because it applies to all foraging strategies: active-capture (both consumer and resource body velocity are important), sit-and-wait (resource velocity dominates) and grazing (consumer velocity dominates). The model predicts that temperature influences consumer-resource interactions primarily through its effects on body velocity (either of the consumer, resource or both), which determines how often consumers and resources encounter each other, and that asymmetries in the thermal responses of interacting species can introduce qualitative, not just quantitative, changes in consumer-resource dynamics. We illustrate this by showing how asymmetries in thermal responses determine equilibrium population densities in interacting consumer-resource pairs. We test for the existence of asymmetries in consumer-resource thermal responses by analysing an extensive database on thermal response curves of ecological traits for 309 species spanning 15 orders of magnitude in body size from terrestrial, marine and freshwater habitats. We find that asymmetries in consumer-resource thermal responses are likely to be a common occurrence. Overall, our study reveals the importance of asymmetric thermal responses in consumer-resource dynamics. In particular, we identify three general types of asymmetries: (i) different levels of performance of the response, (ii) different rates of response (e.g. activation energies) and (iii) different peak or optimal temperatures. Such asymmetries should occur more frequently as the climate changes and species' geographical distributions and phenologies are altered, such that previously noninteracting species come into contact. 6. By using characteristics of trophic interactions that are often well known, such as body size, foraging strategy, thermy and environmental temperature, our framework should allow more accurate predictions about the thermal dependence of consumer-resource interactions. Ultimately, integration of our theory into models of food web and ecosystem dynamics should be useful in understanding how natural systems will respond to current and future temperature change.},

Many regions that have the potential for hypoxic conditions are being fished by mobile bottom-contacting fishing gears. The combined effects of trawling and hypoxia may be synergistic and disproportionally impact benthic fauna, or they may act antagonistically, leading to smaller trawl impacts in hypoxic areas. Yet, few studies have quantified how bottom trawling and hypoxia interact to affect benthic communities. Here we examine these combined effects on benthic community biomass and abundance, the number of large organisms, the longevity distribution of the community and the vertical position of fauna in the sediment in the southern Baltic Sea. We find large declines in benthic biomass and abundance that co-occur with declines in near-bed oxygen concentrations from 5.8 to 0.8 ml O2 l-1. Conversely, no relationships and weak positive relationships are found between bottom trawl disturbance and benthic community biomass and abundance. No interacting effects between hypoxia and trawling are detected. Our findings therefore highlight a low likelihood of synergistic impacts of bottom trawling and hypoxia on the benthic communities studied. These results suggest that management may prioritize benthic protection from fishing in regions that are not in a state of oxygen stress.},

This temperature-sensitivity of growth is frequently used to predict the long-term effects of climate warming on ectotherms. Yet, realized growth also depends on ecological factors and evolutionary adaptation. Here we study whether faster growth is observed along temperature clines within and between marine fish species from polar to tropical regions. Location Global. Time period The sampling or publication year is for 718 observations before 1980, 1,073 observations between 1980 and 2000, and 390 observations after 2000 (for 336 observations no year was recorded). Major taxa studied Marine teleost fish and elasmobranchs. Methods The effects of temperature on fish growth are studied using 2,517 growth observations, representing 771 species in 165 marine ecoregions. The effects of temperature are presented with a Q10, describing relative increase in the rate of growth for each 10 \textdegree C increase. Results We find weak within- and between-species effects of temperature on growth. The typical within-species effect of temperature has a Q10 of 1.1. The between-species effect is a little higher (Q10 = 1.4, or Q10 = 1.2 when corrected for phylogenetic relationships). When analysed per fish guild, growth responses vary from nearly independent of temperature in large demersals (Q10 = 1.1) to positive in small pelagics (Q10 = 1.6) and elasmobranchs (Q10 = 2.3). Average growth is higher in ecoregions with high primary production. Main conclusion The change in average growth along temperature clines is weaker than predicted by metabolic theory, suggesting that the metabolic predictions are not sustainable in an ecosystem context. The long-term response of fish to the increase in temperature associated with climate change may hence be shaped more by local environmental and ecological dynamics than by the physiological temperature response of the species currently present.},

  abstract = {Marine ecosystems, particularly in high-latitude regions such as the Arctic, have been significantly affected by human activities and contributions to climate change. Evaluating how fish populations responded to past changes in their environment is helpful for evaluating their future patterns, but is often hindered by the lack of long-term biological data available. Using otolith increments of Northeast Arctic cod (Gadus morhua) as a proxy for individual growth, we developed a century-scale biochronology (1924\textendash 2014) based on the measurements of 3,894 fish, which revealed significant variations in cod growth over the last 91 years. We combined mixed-effect modeling and path analysis to relate these growth variations to selected climate, population and fishing-related factors. Cod growth was negatively related to cod population size and positively related to capelin population size, one of the most important prey items. This suggests that density-dependent effects are the main source of growth variability due to competition for resources and cannibalism. Growth was also positively correlated with warming sea temperatures but negatively correlated with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, suggesting contrasting effects of climate warming at different spatial scales. Fishing pressure had a significant but weak negative direct impact on growth. Additionally, path analysis revealed that the selected growth factors were interrelated. Capelin biomass was positively related to sea temperature and negatively influenced by herring biomass, while cod biomass was mainly driven by fishing mortality. Together, these results give a better understanding of how multiple interacting factors have shaped cod growth throughout a century, both directly and indirectly.},

  abstract = {Phytoplankton are the base of the Antarctic food web, sustain the wealth and diversity of life for which Antarctica is renowned, and play a critical role in biogeochemical cycles that mediate global climate. Over the vast expanse of the Southern Ocean (SO), the climate is variously predicted to experience increased warming, strengthening wind, acidification, shallowing mixed layer depths, increased light (and UV), changes in upwelling and nutrient replenishment, declining sea ice, reduced salinity, and the southward migration of ocean fronts. These changes are expected to alter the structure and function of phytoplankton communities in the SO. The diverse environments contained within the vast expanse of the SO will be impacted differently by climate change; causing the identity and the magnitude of environmental factors driving biotic change to vary within and among bioregions. Predicting the net effect of multiple climate-induced stressors over a range of environments is complex. Yet understanding the response of SO phytoplankton to climate change is vital if we are to predict the future state/s of the ecosystem, estimate the impacts on fisheries and endangered species, and accurately predict the effects of physical and biotic change in the SO on global climate. This review looks at the major environmental factors that define the structure and function of phytoplankton communities in the SO, examines the forecast changes in the SO environment, predicts the likely effect of these changes on phytoplankton, and considers the ramifications for trophodynamics and feedbacks to global climate change. Predictions strongly suggest that all regions of the SO will experience changes in phytoplankton productivity and community composition with climate change. The nature, and even the sign, of these changes varies within and among regions and will depend upon the magnitude and sequence in which these environmental changes are imposed. It is likely that predicted changes to phytoplankton communities will affect SO biogeochemistry, carbon export, and nutrition for higher trophic levels.},

  abstract = {Worldwide declines of fish stocks raise concerns about deleterious consequences of harvesting for stock abundances and individual life histories, and call for appropriate recovery strategies. Fishes in exploited stocks mature earlier at either larger or smaller sizes due to both genetic and plastic responses. The latter occur commonly when reduced competition for food leads to faster growth. Using a size-structured consumer-resource model, which accounts for both genetic and plastic responses, we show that fisheries-induced evolutionary changes in individual life history and stock properties can easily become irreversible. As a result of annual spawning, early maturation at small sizes and late maturation at large sizes can become alternative, evolutionarily and ecologically stable states under otherwise identical environmental conditions. Exploitation of late-maturing populations can then induce an evolutionary regime shift to smaller maturation sizes associated with stepwise, 1-year decreases in age at first reproduction. Complete and early fishing moratoria slowly reverse this process, but belated or partial closure of fisheries may accelerate or even instigate further evolution to smaller sizes at maturation. We suggest that stepwise decreases in maturation age can be used as early warnings of upcoming evolutionary changes, and should inspire timely restrictions of fisheries.},

We synthesize recent insight into the relationship between size dependence in individual life history and population dynamics. Most studies have focused on size-dependent life-history traits and population size-structure in the highest trophic level, which generally leads to population cycles with a period equal to the juvenile delay. These cycles are driven by differences in competitiveness of differently sized individuals. In multi-trophic systems, size dependence in life-history traits at lower trophic levels may have consequences for both the dynamics and structure of communities, as size-selective predation may lead to the occurrence of emergent Allee effects and the stabilization of predator\textendash prey cycles. These consequences are linked to that individual development is density dependent. We conjecture that especially this population feedback on individual development may lead to new theoretical insight compared to theory based on unstructured or age-dependent models. Density-dependent individual development may also cause individuals to realize radically different life histories, dependent on the state and dynamics of the population during their life and may therefore have consequences for individual behaviour or the evolution of life-history traits as well.},

  abstract = {A ubiquitous feature of natural communities is the variation in size that can be observed between organisms, a variation that to a substantial degree is intraspecific. Size variation within species by necessity implies that ecological interactions vary both in intensity and type over the life cycle of an individual. Physiologically structured population models (PSPMs) constitute a modelling approach especially designed to analyse these size-dependent interactions as they explicitly link individual level processes such as consumption and growth to population dynamics. We discuss two cases where PSPMs have been used to analyse the dynamics of size-structured populations. In the first case, a model of a size-structured consumer population feeding on a non-structured prey was successful in predicting both qualitative (mechanisms) and quantitative (individual growth, survival, cycle amplitude) aspects of the population dynamics of a planktivorous fish population. We conclude that single generation cycles as a result of intercohort competition is a general outcome of size-structured consumer\textendash resource interactions. In the second case, involving both cohort competition and cannibalism, we show that PSPMs may predict double asymptotic growth trajectories with individuals ending up as giants. These growth trajectories, which have also been observed in field data, could not be predicted from individual level information, but are emergent properties of the population feedback on individual processes. In contrast to the size-structured consumer\textendash resource model, the dynamics in this case cannot be reduced to simpler lumped stage-based models, but can only be analysed within the domain of PSPMs. Parameter values used in PSPMs adhere to the individual level and are derived independently from the system at focus, whereas model predictions involve both population level processes and individual level processes under conditions of population feedback. This leads to an increased ability to test model predictions but also to a larger set of variables that is predicted at both the individual and population level. The results turn out to be relatively robust to specific model assumptions and thus render a higher degree of generality than purely individual-based models. At the same time, PSPMs offer a much higher degree of realism, precision and testing ability than lumped stage-based or non-structured models. The results of our analyses so far suggest that also in more complex species configurations only a limited set of mechanisms determines the dynamics of PSPMs. We therefore conclude that there is a high potential for developing an individual-based, size-dependent community theory using PSPMs.},

This stage-structured model is derived as an approximation to a physiologically structured population model, which accounts for a complete size-distribution of the consumer population and which is based on assumptions about the energy budget and size-dependent life history of individual consumers. The approximation ensures that under equilibrium conditions predictions of both models are completely identical. In addition we find that under non-equilibrium conditions the stage-structured model gives rise to dynamics that closely approximate the dynamics exhibited by the size-structured model, as long as adult consumers are superior foragers than juveniles with a higher mass-specific ingestion rate. When the mass-specific intake rate of juvenile consumers is higher, the size-structured model exhibits single-generation cycles, in which a single cohort of consumers dominates population dynamics throughout its life time and the population composition varies over time between a dominance by juveniles and adults, respectively. The stage-structured model does not capture these dynamics because it incorporates a distributed time delay between the birth and maturation of an individual organism in contrast to the size-structured model, in which maturation is a discrete event in individual life history. We investigate model dynamics with both semi-chemostat and logistic resource growth.},

Using a size-structured, individual-based model we show that catastrophic population collapses may nonetheless be an intrinsic property of many communities, because of two general aspects of individual life history: size- and food-dependent individual growth and individual mortality decreasing with body size. Positive density dependence, characteristic for depensatory growth mechanisms and catastrophic behavior, results as a direct and robust consequence of the interplay between these individual life-history traits, which are commonly found in many species.},

Particularly the change in the (age, size)-relation with a change in the food availability seems to be an important behavioural mechanism that strongly influences the dynamics. This influence is partly stabilizing and partly destabilizing and leads to the coexistence of a stable equilibrium and a stable limit cycle or even coexistence of two stable limit cycles for the same parameter values.

Here, we show that competing predator species may not only coexist on a single prey but even help each other to persist if they specialize on different life history stages of the prey. By changing the prey size distribution, a predator species may in fact increase the amount of prey available for its competitor. Surprisingly, a predator may not be able to persist at all unless its competitor is also present. The competitor thus significantly increases the range of conditions for which a particular predator can persist. This "emergent facilitation" is a long-term, population-level effect that results from asymmetric increases in the rate of prey maturation and reproduction when predation relaxes competition among prey. Emergent facilitation explains observations of correlated increases of predators on small and large conspecific prey as well as concordance in their distribution patterns. Our results suggest that emergent facilitation may promote the occurrence of complex, stable, community food webs and that persistence of these communities could critically depend on diversity within predator guilds.},

In turn, these models constitute the basis for our understanding of the functioning of ecological communities and ecosystems and their responses to environmental change, natural disturbances and human impacts. Structured models that take into account differences between individuals in age, stage or size have been shown to sometimes make predictions that run counter to the predictions of unstructured analogues. It is however unclear which biological mechanisms that are accounted for in the structured models give rise to these contrasting predictions. Focusing on two particular rules-of-thumb that generally hold in unstructured consumer-resource models, one relating to the relationship between mortality and equilibrium density of the consumer and the other relating to the stability of the equilibrium, I investigate the necessary conditions under which accounting for juvenile-adult stage structure can lead to qualitatively different model predictions. In particular, juvenile-adult stage structure is shown to overturn the two rules-of-thumb in case the model also accounts for the energetic requirements for basic metabolic maintenance. Given the fundamental nature of both juvenile-adult stage structure as well as metabolic maintenance requirements, these results call into question the generality of the predictions derived from unstructured models.},

  abstract = {Double trouble It is well known that climate change will warm ocean waters, but dissolved oxygen levels also decrease as water warms. Deutsch et al. combined data on metabolism, temperature, and demographics to determine the impact of marine deoxygenation on a variety of fish and crustacean species (see the Perspective by Kleypas). Predicted climate and oxygen conditions can be expected to contract the distribution of marine fish poleward, as equatorward waters become too low in oxygen to support their energy needs. Furthermore, even the more-poleward waters will have reduced oxygen levels. Science, this issue p. 1132; see also p. 1086 Warming of the oceans and consequent loss of dissolved oxygen (O2) will alter marine ecosystems, but a mechanistic framework to predict the impact of multiple stressors on viable habitat is lacking. Here, we integrate physiological, climatic, and biogeographic data to calibrate and then map a key metabolic index\textemdash the ratio of O2 supply to resting metabolic O2 demand\textemdash across geographic ranges of several marine ectotherms. These species differ in thermal and hypoxic tolerances, but their contemporary distributions are all bounded at the equatorward edge by a minimum metabolic index of \textasciitilde 2 to 5, indicative of a critical energetic requirement for organismal activity. The combined effects of warming and O2 loss this century are projected to reduce the upper ocean's metabolic index by \textasciitilde 20\% globally and by \textasciitilde 50\% in northern high-latitude regions, forcing poleward and vertical contraction of metabolically viable habitats and species ranges. Warming waters and reduced O2 will contract fish distributions poleward. [Also see Perspective by Kleypas] Warming waters and reduced O2 will contract fish distributions poleward.

We observe a tight correlation between the metabolic rate and~the efficacy of oxygen supply, and between~the temperature sensitivities of these traits, which suggests that marine animals are under strong selection for the tolerance of~low O2 (hypoxia)5. The breadth of the resulting physiological tolerances of marine animals predicts a variety of geographical niches\textemdash from the tropics to high latitudes and from shallow to deep water\textemdash which better align with species distributions than do models based on either temperature or oxygen alone. For all studied species, thermal and hypoxic limits are substantially reduced by the energetic demands of ecological activity, a trait that varies similarly among marine and terrestrial taxa. Active temperature-dependent hypoxia thus links the biogeography of diverse marine species to fundamental energetic requirements that are shared across the animal kingdom.},

Many ecological variables other than stage, such as habitat type, site occupancy and metapopulation status are also modelled using transitions among discrete states. Transitions among life stages can be characterised by the distribution of time spent in each stage, including the mean and variance of each stage duration and within-individual correlations among multiple stage durations. Three modelling traditions represent stage durations differently. Matrix models can be derived as a long-run approximation from any distribution of stage durations, but they are often interpreted directly as a Markov model for stage transitions. Statistical stage-duration distribution models accommodate the variation typical of cohort development data, but such realism has rarely been incorporated in population theory or statistical population models. Delay-differential equation models include lags but no variation, except in limited cases. We synthesise these models in one framework and illustrate how individual variation and correlations in development can impact population growth. Furthermore, different development models can yield the same long-term matrix transition rates but different sensitivities and elasticities. Finally, we discuss future directions for estimating realistic stage duration models from data.},

From the beginning (the first packages were written in the 1970's) it was also used in the modelling process, in particular to determine the values of critical parameters. More recently, it is used in a systematic way in the design of dynamical models and to determine which parameters are relevant. MatCont and Cl\_MatCont are freely available matlab numerical continuation packages for the interactive study of dynamical systems and bifurcations. MatCont is the GUI-version, Cl\_MatCont is the command-line version. The work started in 2000 and the first publications appeared in 2003. Since that time many new functionalities were added. Some of these are fairly simple but were never before implemented in continuation codes, e.g. Poincar\'e maps. Others were only available as toolboxes that can be used by experts, e.g. continuation of homoclinic orbits. Several others were never implemented at all, such as periodic normal forms for codimension 1 bifurcations of limit cycles, normal forms for codimension 2 bifurcations of equilibria, detection of codimension 2 bifurcations of limit cycles, automatic computation of phase response curves and their derivatives, continuation of branch points of equilibria and limit cycles. New numerical algorithms for these computations have been published or will appear elsewhere; here we restrict to their software implementation. We further discuss software issues that are in practice important for many users, e.g. how to define a new system starting from an existing one, how to import and export data, system descriptions, and computed results.},

Several large systems, with historical data, that never reported hypoxia at the turn of the 19th century (e.g., Kattegat, the sea between Sweden and Denmark) now experience severe seasonal hypoxia. Synthesis of literature pertaining to benthic hypoxia and anoxia revealed that the oxygen budgets of many major coastal ecosystems have been adversely affected mainly through the process of eutrophication (the production of excess organic matter). It appears that many ecosystems that are now severely stressed by hypoxia may be near or at a threshold of change or collapse (loss of fisheries, loss of biodiversity, alteration of food webs).},

Enhanced primary production results in an accumulation of particulate organic matter, which encourages microbial activity and the consumption of dissolved oxygen in bottom waters.

Recently, maximum economic yield (MEY) has been identified as a primary management objective for Australian fisheries and is under consideration elsewhere. However, first attempts at estimating MEY as an actual management target for a real fishery (rather than a conceptual or theoretical exercise) have highlighted some substantial complexities generally unconsidered by fisheries economists. Here, we highlight some of the main issues encountered in our experience and their implications for estimating and transitioning to MEY. Using a bioeconomic model of an Australian fishery for which MEY is the management target, we note that unconstrained optimization may result in effort trajectories that would not be acceptable to industry or managers. Different assumptions regarding appropriate constraints result in different outcomes, each of which may be considered a valid MEY. Similarly, alternative treatments of prices and costs may result in differing estimates of MEY and their associated effort trajectories. To develop an implementable management strategy in an adaptive management framework, a set of assumptions must be agreed among scientists, economists, and industry and managers, indicating that operationalizing MEY is not simply a matter of estimating the numbers but requires strong industry commitment and involvement.},

Five Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) General Circulation Models (GCMs) using three different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) have been downscaled with the coupled atmosphere\&ndash;ice\&ndash;ocean model RCA4-NEMO. Validation of sea surface temperature (SST) against different datasets suggests that the model results are well within the spread of observational datasets. The ensemble mean SST with a bias of less than 1      {$\circ$}    C is the solution that fits the observations best and underlines the importance of ensemble modeling. The exchange of momentum, heat, and freshwater between atmosphere and ocean in the regional, coupled model compares well with available datasets. The climatological seasonal cycles of these fluxes are within the 95\% confidence limits of the datasets. Towards the end of the 21st century the projected North Sea SST increases by 1.5      {$\circ$}    C (RCP 2.6), 2      {$\circ$}    C (RCP 4.5), and 4      {$\circ$}    C (RCP 8.5), respectively. Under this change the North Sea develops a specific pattern of the climate change signal for the air\&ndash;sea temperature difference and latent heat flux in the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. In the RCP 8.5 scenario the amplitude of the spatial heat flux anomaly increases to 5 W/m     2     at the end of the century. Different hypotheses are discussed that could contribute to the spatially non-uniform change in air\&ndash;sea interaction. The most likely cause for an increased latent heat loss in the central western North Sea is a drier atmosphere towards the end of the century. Drier air in the lee of the British Isles affects the balance of the surface heat budget of the North Sea. This effect is an example of how regional characteristics modulate global climate change. For climate change projections on regional scales it is important to resolve processes and feedbacks at regional scales.},

  abstract = {Collinearity refers to the non independence of predictor variables, usually in a regression-type analysis. It is a common feature of any descriptive ecological data set and can be a problem for parameter estimation because it inflates the variance of regression parameters and hence potentially leads to the wrong identification of relevant predictors in a statistical model. Collinearity is a severe problem when a model is trained on data from one region or time, and predicted to another with a different or unknown structure of collinearity. To demonstrate the reach of the problem of collinearity in ecology, we show how relationships among predictors differ between biomes, change over spatial scales and through time. Across disciplines, different approaches to addressing collinearity problems have been developed, ranging from clustering of predictors, threshold-based pre-selection, through latent variable methods, to shrinkage and regularisation. Using simulated data with five predictor-response relationships of increasing complexity and eight levels of collinearity we compared ways to address collinearity with standard multiple regression and machine-learning approaches. We assessed the performance of each approach by testing its impact on prediction to new data. In the extreme, we tested whether the methods were able to identify the true underlying relationship in a training dataset with strong collinearity by evaluating its performance on a test dataset without any collinearity. We found that methods specifically designed for collinearity, such as latent variable methods and tree based models, did not outperform the traditional GLM and threshold-based pre-selection. Our results highlight the value of GLM in combination with penalised methods (particularly ridge) and threshold-based pre-selection when omitted variables are considered in the final interpretation. However, all approaches tested yielded degraded predictions under change in collinearity structure and the `folk lore'-thresholds of correlation coefficients between predictor variables of |r| {$>$}0.7 was an appropriate indicator for when collinearity begins to severely distort model estimation and subsequent prediction. The use of ecological understanding of the system in pre-analysis variable selection and the choice of the least sensitive statistical approaches reduce the problems of collinearity, but cannot ultimately solve them.},

  abstract = {Proportional data, in which response variables are expressed as percentages or fractions of a whole, are analysed in many subfields of ecology and evolution. The scale-independence of proportions makes them appropriate to analyse many biological phenomena, but statistical analyses are not straightforward, since proportions can only take values from zero to one and their variance is usually not constant across the range of the predictor. Transformations to overcome these problems are often applied, but can lead to biased estimates and difficulties in interpretation. In this paper, we provide an overview of the different types of proportional data and discuss the different analysis strategies available. In particular, we review and discuss the use of promising, but little used, techniques for analysing continuous (also called non-count-based or non-binomial) proportions (e.g. percent cover, fraction time spent on an activity): beta and Dirichlet regression, and some of their most important extensions. A major distinction can be made between proportions arising from counts and those arising from continuous measurements. For proportions consisting of two categories, count-based data are best analysed using well-developed techniques such as logistic regression, while continuous proportions can be analysed with beta regression models. In the case of {$>$}2 categories, multinomial logistic regression or Dirichlet regression can be applied. Both beta and Dirichlet regression techniques model proportions at their original scale, which makes statistical inference more straightforward and produce less biased estimates relative to transformation-based solutions. Extensions to beta regression, such as models for variable dispersion, zero-one augmented data and mixed effects designs have been developed and are reviewed and applied to case studies. Finally, we briefly discuss some issues regarding model fitting, inference, and reporting that are particularly relevant to beta and Dirichlet regression. Beta regression and Dirichlet regression overcome some problems inherent in applying classic statistical approaches to proportional data. To facilitate the adoption of these techniques by practitioners in ecology and evolution, we present detailed, annotated demonstration scripts covering all variations of beta and Dirichlet regression discussed in the article, implemented in the freely available language for statistical computing, r.},

  abstract = {1. How body mass and body temperature influence metabolic rate has been of interest for decades. Today that interest can be seen in the form of debates over the proper scaling coefficients, and the mechanistic underpinnings of allometric models for metabolic rate in relation to body mass and body temperature. We tested explicit assumptions built into what we term the Arrhenius fractal supply (AFS) model of these relationships. This model, and its assumptions, is foundational to the controversial Metabolic Theory of Ecology. 2. In addition to predicting that the scaling exponent for body mass is 3/4, the AFS model originally predicted that metabolic responses to body temperature, measured as activation energies, should fall between 0.2 and 1.2 eV. More recently, the latter range was narrowed to 0.6 and 0.7 eV. 3. To test the AFS's predictions, we used multiple regression of ln(metabolic rate) as a function of ln(body mass) and 1/(body temperature) to fit the best scaling exponent for body mass to nine data sets of many diverse species. 4. For the majority of the data sets, in addition to not supporting a scaling exponent of 3/4, the analyses indicated that effects of body temperature sometimes fell outside the range of 0.6-0.7 eV, indicating that the predictions of the AFS model do not hold universally. 5. Effects of body temperature, however, did fall within the range of 0.2-1.2 eV. To aid interpretation of these results, we transformed activation energies into Q(10)s. At ecologically realistic temperatures, the values of Q(10) that approximate activation energies of 0.2-1.2 eV ranged from c. 1.4 to 6.1 (where 6.1 is clearly unreasonably high). Hence, any model that predicts activation energies between 0.2 and 1.2 eV does not appear to be an informative scaling model at the organismal level. 6. The AFS model is foundational for the Metabolic Theory of Ecology. While we commend the attempt to incorporate scaling of metabolism into ecological theory, and the research it has inspired, we caution against using untested, and likely incorrect, assumptions as a foundation to a general theory of ecology. We recommend that scientists allow the data to determine the best model for incorporating energetics into ecological theory.},

A generalized additive modelling (GAM) approach is used to describe the abundance of 40 species groups (i.e. functional groups) across the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) using a large fisheries independent data set (SEAMAP) and climate scale oceanographic conditions. Predictor variables included in the model are chlorophyll a, sediment type, dissolved oxygen, temperature, and depth. Despite the presence of a large number of zeros in the data, a single GAM using a negative binomial distribution was suitable to make predictions of abundance for multiple functional groups. We present an example case study using pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus duroarum) and compare the results to known distributions. The model successfully predicts the known areas of high abundance in the GoM, including those areas where no data was inputted into the model fitting. Overall, the model reliably captures areas of high and low abundance for the large majority of functional groups observed in SEAMAP. The result of this method allows for the objective setting of spatial distributions for numerous functional groups across a modeling domain, even where abundance data may not exist.},

Here, we use the APECOSM-E numerical model (Apex Predator ECOSystem Model - Estimation) to evaluate the future impacts of climate change on the physiology, spatial distribution, and abundance of skipjack tuna, the worldwide most fished species of tropical tuna. The main novelties of our approach lie in the mechanistic link between environmental factors, metabolic rates, and behavioral responses and in the fully three dimensional representation of habitat and population abundance. Physical and biogeochemical fields used to force the model are provided by the last generation of the IPSL-CM5 Earth System Model run from 1990 to 2100 under a `business-as-usual' scenario (RCP8.5). Our simulations show significant changes in the spatial distribution of skipjack tuna suitable habitat, as well as in their population abundance. The model projects deterioration of skipjack habitat in most tropical waters and an improvement of habitat at higher latitudes. The primary driver of habitat changes is ocean warming, followed by food density changes. Our projections show an increase of global skipjack biomass between 2010 and 2050 followed by a marked decrease between 2050 and 2095. Spawning rates are consistent with population trends, showing that spawning depends primarily on the adult biomass. On the other hand, growth rates display very smooth temporal changes, suggesting that the ability of skipjack to keep high metabolic rates in the changing environment is generally effective. Uncertainties related to our model spatial resolution, to the lack or simplification of key processes and to the climate forcings are discussed.},

  abstract = {Catch-curve analysis is a common method for estimating the total mortality rate (Z) from age-frequency data in fisheries research. Methods for determining Z include the Chapman\textendash Robson estimator (CR), and regression-based methods, here called RG (simple regression), R1 (truncate at one regression) and R5 (truncate at five regression). This paper investigates the sensitivity of CR and the regression estimators of Z when stochastic error is present in the true mortality rate, recruitment and in ageing. We consider the accuracy and precision of each of these estimators for errors introduced both collectively and individually. CR was found to be more accurate in most of the simulation scenarios, i.e., had a lower root mean squared error (RMSE), and also tended to have lower bias than the regression estimators. While a regression estimator (usually either R1 or RG) occasionally performed better than CR, the level of increased performance was slight. RG, the simplest implementation of the regression estimator, was often the most strongly negatively biased. The performance of all estimators degraded with increasing Z and with increased levels of introduced error. Using sample sizes defined by a coefficient of variation for sampling error of 20\%, variation in mortality defined by an annual coefficient of variation of 20\%, recruitment variance with standard deviation 0.7 (log scale) with autocorrelated errors, CR was found to have a percent root mean squared error (of the true mortality rate) of 22\% when Z=0.2yr-1 and 28\% at Z=0.8yr-1. Corresponding values were 24 and 37\% for R1; 31 and 38\% for RG; and 41 and 44\% for R5.},

  abstract = {Size spectra are recommended tools for detecting the response of marine communities to fishing or to management measures. A size spectrum succinctly describes how a property, such as abundance or biomass, varies with body size in a community. Required data are often collected in binned form, such as numbers of individuals in 1 cm length bins. Numerous methods have been employed to fit size spectra, but most give biased estimates when tested on simulated data, and none account for the data's bin structure (breakpoints of bins). Here, we used 8 methods to fit an annual size-spectrum exponent, b, to an example data set (30 yr of the North Sea International Bottom Trawl Survey). The methods gave conflicting conclusions regarding b declining (the size spectrum steepening) through time, and so any resulting advice to ecosystem managers will be highly dependent upon the method used. Using simulated data, we showed that ignoring the bin structure gives biased estimates of b, even for high-resolution data. However, our extended likelihood method, which explicitly accounts for the bin structure, accurately estimated b and its confidence intervals, even for coarsely collected data. We developed a novel visualisation method that accounts for the bin structure and associated uncertainty, provide recommendations concerning different data types and have created an R package (sizeSpectra) to reproduce all results and encourage use of our methods. This work is also relevant to wider applications where a power-law distribution (the underlying distribution for a size spectrum) is fitted to binned data.},

Poor notation can impede communication and understanding of ideas, and make models appear more complicated than necessary.

Although we focus mainly on ecology, our guidelines should be of interest to researchers applying models in evolutionary biology and broader areas of biology.},

The effects of harvesting the predators are investigated by making the predator mortality rate habitat dependent. Results demonstrate that for any given set of parameter values there is a value of the intrinsic preference of the predator for each prey type at which the system undergoes a Hopf bifurcation. Above this critical value the system evolves towards a stable equilibrium, whereas below it, stable limit cycles arise by Hopf bifurcations. Simulations demonstrate that the presence of demographic stochasticity may destabilise oscillatory populations, thereby causing population extinctions. An application of the model to the foraging behaviour of North Sea cod is described. It is shown that if the preferred prey is more productive, it is likely that the equilibrium will be stable, whereas if the less preferred prey is more productive, populations are likely to display cycles and in the stochastic case become extinct. As cod fishing mortality is increased, the point of bifurcation and region of parameter space for which the system is unstable decreases. An increased understanding of how cod behave may enable fish stocks to be managed more successfully, for example by indicating where marine reserves should be placed.},

  abstract = {The size spectrum of an ecological community characterizes how a property, such as abundance or biomass, varies with body size. Size spectra are often used as ecosystem indicators of marine systems. They have been fitted to data from various sources, including groundfish trawl surveys, visual surveys of fish in kelp forests and coral reefs, sediment samples of benthic invertebrates and satellite remote sensing of chlorophyll. Over the past decades, several methods have been used to fit size spectra to data. We document eight such methods, demonstrating their commonalities and differences. Seven methods use linear regression (of which six require binning of data), while the eighth uses maximum likelihood estimation. We test the accuracy of the methods on simulated data. We demonstrate that estimated size-spectrum slopes are not always comparable between the seven regression-based methods because such methods are not estimating the same parameter. We find that four of the eight tested methods can sometimes give reasonably accurate estimates of the exponent of the individual size distribution (which is related to the slope of the size spectrum). However, sensitivity analyses find that maximum likelihood estimation is the only method that is consistently accurate, and the only one that yields reliable confidence intervals for the exponent. We therefore recommend the use of maximum likelihood estimation when fitting size spectra. To facilitate this, we provide documented R code for fitting and plotting results. This should provide consistency in future studies and improve the quality of any resulting advice to ecosystem managers. In particular, the calculation of reliable confidence intervals will allow proper consideration of uncertainty when making management decisions.},

  abstract = {Eastern Baltic cod is an example of a fish stock where fishing pressure has substantially declined after decades of intensive exploitation. However, in contrast to the expected improvements in stock status, stock productivity has concurrently declined to a historic low level. Targeted fisheries for the eastern Baltic cod were recently banned. However, at present low growth and high natural mortality, the stock biomass is projected to remain low, even in the absence of fishing. Thus, the future development in this stock and its potential recovery are largely dependent on ecosystem drivers likely contributing to the presently poor state of the cod stock (e.g. oxygen conditions, spatial distribution of prey species, abundance of marine mammals). Some of these ecosystem drivers and associated impacts on cod may be possible to influence by management measures, which are however not straightforward to implement. Moreover, scientific knowledge to guide management decisions in a complex ecosystem context is lagging behind. The Baltic cod case exemplifies the complexity of questions emerging for management as well as scientific advice under rapidly changing ecosystem conditions, where traditional fisheries management alone may have a limited potential to rebuild the stock.},

Many theories have been proposed to explain these scaling relationships, but were challenged by empirically documented curvatures on double-logarithmic scales. In the present study, we present a novel data set comprising 3661 terrestrial (mainly soil) invertebrate respiration rates from 192 independent sources across a wide range in body masses, environmental temperatures and phylogenetic groups. Although our analyses documented power-law and exponential scaling with body masses and temperature, respectively, polynomial models identified curved deviations. Interestingly, complex scaling models accounting for phylogenetic groups were able to remove curvatures except for a negative curvature at the highest temperatures (\textbackslash textgreater30 \textdegree C) indicating metabolic down regulation. This might indicate that the tremendous differences in invertebrate body architectures, ecology and physiology may cause severely different metabolic scaling processes.},

  abstract = {Fish stocks experiencing high fishing mortality show a tendency to mature earlier and at a smaller size, which may have a genetic component and therefore long-lasting economic and biological effects. To date, the economic effects of such ecoevolutionary dynamics have not been empirically investigated. Using 70 y of data, we develop a bioeconomic model for Northeast Arctic cod to compare the economic yield in a model in which life-history traits can vary only through phenotypic plasticity with a model in which, in addition, genetic changes can occur. We find that evolutionary changes toward faster growth and earlier maturation occur consistently even if a stock is optimally managed. However, if a stock is managed optimally, the evolutionary changes actually increase economic yield because faster growth and earlier maturation raise the stock's productivity. The optimal fishing mortality is almost identical for the evolutionary and nonevolutionary model and substantially lower than what it has been historically. Therefore, the costs of ignoring evolution under optimal management regimes are negligible. However, if fishing mortality is as high as it has been historically, evolutionary changes may result in economic losses, but only if the fishery is selecting for medium-sized individuals. Because evolution facilitates growth, the fish are younger and still immature when they are susceptible to getting caught, which outweighs the increase in productivity due to fish spawning at an earlier age.},

  abstract = {The relative roles of density dependence and life history evolution in contributing to rapid fisheries-induced trait changes remain debated. In the 1930s, northeast Arctic cod (Gadus morhua), currently the world's largest cod stock, experienced a shift from a traditional spawning-ground fishery to an industrial trawl fishery with elevated exploitation in the stock's feeding grounds. Since then, age and length at maturation have declined dramatically, a trend paralleled in other exploited stocks worldwide. These trends can be explained by demographic truncation of the population's age structure, phenotypic plasticity in maturation arising through density-dependent growth, fisheries-induced evolution favoring faster-growing or earlier-maturing fish, or a combination of these processes. Here, we use a multitrait eco-evolutionary model to assess the capacity of these processes to reproduce 74 y of historical data on age and length at maturation in northeast Arctic cod, while mimicking the stock's historical harvesting regime. Our results show that model predictions critically depend on the assumed density dependence of growth: when this is weak, life history evolution might be necessary to prevent stock collapse, whereas when a stronger density dependence estimated from recent data is used, the role of evolution in explaining fisheries-induced trait changes is diminished. Our integrative analysis of density-dependent growth, multitrait evolution, and stock-specific time series data underscores the importance of jointly considering evolutionary and ecological processes, enabling a more comprehensive perspective on empirically observed stock dynamics than previous studies could provide.},

The high-resolution circulation model is used to simulate the time period from 1902 to 1998 using reconstructed physical forcing and climatological nutrient loads of the late 20th century. The analysis of the results covers the last 30~years of the simulation period. The results emphasize the importance of internal phosphorus and oxygen dynamics, the variability of physical conditions and the natural long-term variability of phosphorus supplies from land on the phosphorus content in the Baltic Sea. These mechanisms play an important role on the variability of available surface layer phosphorus in late winter in the Baltic Sea. The content of cyanobacteria increases with the availability of phosphorus in the surface layers of the Baltic proper and the probability for large cyanobacteria blooms in the model is rapidly increased at higher concentrations of excess dissolved inorganic phosphorus in late winter. The natural increase of phosphorus supplies from land due to increased river runoff since the early 1970s may to a large degree explain the increased phosphorus content in the Baltic proper. Another significant fraction of the increase is explained by the release of phosphorus from increased anoxic areas during the period. These results refer to the long-term variability of the phosphorus cycle. In accordance to earlier publications is the short-term (i.e. interannual) variability of the phosphorus content in the Baltic proper mainly explained by oxygen dependent sediment fluxes.},

One influential hypothesis explaining this observation is that the challenge of obtaining sufficient oxygen to support metabolism becomes greater with increasing body size, and more so at high temperatures. Yet, previous models based on this hypothesis do not account for phenotypic plasticity in the physiology of organisms that counteracts oxygen limitation at high temperature. Here, we model the predicted strength of the temperature-size response using estimates of how both the oxygen supply and demand is affected by temperature when allowing for phenotypic plasticity in the aquatic ectotherm Daphnia magna. Our predictions remain highly inconsistent with empirical temperature-size responses, with the prior being close to one order of magnitude stronger than the latter. These results fail to provide quantitative support for the hypothesis that oxygen limitation drives temperature-size clines in aquatic ectotherms. Future studies into the role of oxygen limitation should address how the strength of the temperature-size response may be shaped by evolution under fluctuating temperature regimes. Finally, our results caution against applying deterministic models based on the oxygen limitation hypothesis when predicting future changes in ectotherm size distributions under climate change.},

  abstract = {Over the past several decades, a substantial amount of research has examined how cardiorespiratory physiology supports the diverse activities performed throughout the life cycle of Pacific salmon, genus Oncorhynchus. Pioneering experiments emphasized the importance of aerobic scope in setting the functional thermal tolerance for activity in fishes. Variation in routine metabolism can have important performance and fitness consequences as it is related to dominance, aggression, boldness, territoriality, growth rate, postprandial oxygen consumption, life history, season, time of day, availability of shelter and social interactions. Wild fishes must perform many activities simultaneously (e.g. swim, obtain prey, avoid predators, compete, digest and reproduce) and oxygen delivery is allocated among competing organ systems according to the capacity of the heart to deliver blood. For example, salmonids that are simultaneously swimming and digesting trade-off maximum swimming performance in order to support the oxygen demands of digestion. As adult Pacific salmonids cease feeding in the ocean prior to their home migration, endogenous energy reserves and cardiac capacity are primarily partitioned among the demands for swimming upriver, sexual maturation and spawning behaviours. Furthermore, the upriver spawning migration is under strong selection pressure, given that Pacific salmonids are semelparous (single opportunity to spawn). Consequently, these fishes optimize energy expenditures in a number of ways: strong homing, precise migration timing, choosing forward-assist current paths and exploiting the boundary layer to avoid the strong currents in the middle of the river, using energetically efficient swimming speeds, and recovering rapidly from anaerobic swimming. Upon arrival at the spawning ground, remaining energy can be strategically allocated to the various spawning behaviours. Strong fidelity to natal streams has resulted in reproductively isolated populations that appear to be locally adapted physiologically to their specific environmental conditions. Populations with more challenging migrations have enhanced cardiorespiratory performance. Pacific salmonids are able to maintain aerobic scope across the broad range of temperatures encountered historically during their migration; however, climate change-induced river warming has created lethal conditions for many populations, raising conservation concerns. Despite considerable research examining cardiorespiratory physiology in Pacific salmonids over the last 70 years, critical knowledge gaps are identified.},

  abstract = {Bayesian inference is an important statistical tool that is increasingly being used by ecologists. In a Bayesian analysis, information available before a study is conducted is summarized in a quantitative model or hypothesis: the prior probability distribution. Bayes' Theorem uses the prior probability distribution and the likelihood of the data to generate a posterior probability distribution. Posterior probability distributions are an epistemological alternative to P-values and provide a direct measure of the degree of belief that can be placed on models, hypotheses, or parameter estimates. Moreover, Bayesian information-theoretic methods provide robust measures of the probability of alternative models, and multiple models can be averaged into a single model that reflects uncertainty in model construction and selection. These methods are demonstrated through a simple worked example. Ecologists are using Bayesian inference in studies that range from predicting single-species population dynamics to understanding ecosystem processes. Not all ecologists, however, appreciate the philosophical underpinnings of Bayesian inference. In particular, Bayesians and frequentists differ in their definition of probability and in their treatment of model parameters as random variables or estimates of true values. These assumptions must be addressed explicitly before deciding whether or not to use Bayesian methods to analyse ecological data.},

  abstract = {Aim There has been a wide interest in the effect of biotic interactions on species' occurrences and abundances at large spatial scales, coupled with a vast development of the statistical methods to study them. Still, evidence for whether the effects of within-trophic-level biotic interactions (e.g. competition and heterospecific attraction) are discernible beyond local scales remains inconsistent. Here, we present a novel hypothesis-testing framework based on joint dynamic species distribution models and functional trait similarity to dissect between environmental filtering and biotic interactions. Location France and Finland. Taxon Birds. Methods We estimated species-to-species associations within a trophic level, independent of the main environmental variables (mean temperature and total precipitation) for common species at large spatial scale with joint dynamic species distribution (a multivariate spatiotemporal delta model) models. We created hypotheses based on species' functionality (morphological and/or diet dissimilarity) and habitat preferences about the sign and strength of the pairwise spatiotemporal associations to estimate the extent to which they result from biotic interactions (competition, heterospecific attraction) and/or environmental filtering. Results Spatiotemporal associations were mostly positive (80\%), followed by random (15\%), and only 5\% were negative. Where detected, negative spatiotemporal associations in different communities were due to a few species. The relationship between spatiotemporal association and functional dissimilarity among species was negative, which fulfils the predictions of both environmental filtering and heterospecific attraction. Main conclusions We showed that processes leading to species aggregation (mixture between environmental filtering and heterospecific attraction) seem to dominate assembly rules, and we did not find evidence for competition. Altogether, our hypothesis-testing framework based on joint dynamic species distribution models and functional trait similarity is beneficial in ecological interpretation of species-to-species associations from data covering several decades and biogeographical regions.},

  abstract = {Recent research has generally shown that a small change in the number of species in a food web can have consequences both for community structure and ecosystem processes. However 'change' is not limited to just the number of species in a community, but might include an alteration to such properties as precipitation, nutrient cycling and temperature. How such changes might affect species interactions is important, not just through the presence or absence of interactions, but also because the patterning of interaction strengths among species is intimately associated with community stability. Interaction strengths encompass such properties as feeding rates and assimilation efficiencies, and encapsulate functionally important information with regard to ecosystem processes. Interaction strengths represent the pathways and transfer of energy through an ecosystem. We review the best empirical data available detailing the frequency distribution of interaction strengths in communities. We present the underlying (but consistent) pattern of species interactions and discuss the implications of this patterning. We then examine how such a basic pattern might be affected given various scenarios of 'change' and discuss the consequences for community stability and ecosystem functioning.},

  abstract = {The interest in fishing-induced life-history evolution has been growing in the last decade, in part because of the increasing number of studies suggesting evolutionary changes in life-history traits, and the potential ecological and economic consequences these changes may have. Among the traits that could evolve in response to fishing, growth has lately received attention. However, critical reading of the literature on growth evolution in fish reveals conceptual confusion about the nature of `growth' itself as an evolving trait, and about the different ways fishing can affect growth and size-at-age of fish, both on ecological and on evolutionary time-scales. It is important to separate the advantages of being big and the costs of growing to a large size, particularly when studying life-history evolution. In this review, we explore the selection pressures on growth and the resultant evolution of growth from a mechanistic viewpoint. We define important concepts and outline the processes that must be accounted for before observed phenotypic changes can be ascribed to growth evolution. When listing traits that could be traded-off with growth rate, we group the mechanisms into those affecting resource acquisition and those governing resource allocation. We summarize potential effects of fishing on traits related to growth and discuss methods for detecting evolution of growth. We also challenge the prevailing expectation that fishing-induced evolution should always lead to slower growth.},

For North Sea cod, we show for the first time and in great spatial detail how the stock has shifted its distribution over the past 100 years. We digitized extensive historical fisheries data from paper charts in UK government archives and combined these with contemporary data to a time-series spanning 1913\textendash 2012 (excluding both World Wars). New analysis of old data revealed that the current distribution pattern of cod \textendash{} mostly in the deeper, northern- and north-easternmost parts of the North Sea \textendash{} is almost opposite to that during most of the Twentieth Century \textendash{} mainly concentrated in the west, off England and Scotland. Statistical analysis revealed that the deepening, northward shift is likely attributable to warming; however, the eastward shift is best explained by fishing pressure, suggestive of significant depletion of the stock from its previous stronghold, off the coasts of England and Scotland. These spatial patterns were confirmed for the most recent 3{$\frac{1}{2}$} decades by data from fisheries-independent surveys, which go back to the 1970s. Our results demonstrate the fundamental importance of both climate change and fishing pressure for our understanding of changing distributions of commercially exploited fish.},

  abstract = {The eastern Baltic cod (Gadus morhua) population has been decreasing in the Baltic Sea for at least 30 years. Condition indices of the Baltic cod have decreased, and previous studies have suggested that this might be due to overfishing, predation, lower dissolved oxygen or changes in salinity. However, numerous studies from the Baltic Sea have demonstrated an ongoing thiamine deficiency in several animal classes, both invertebrates and vertebrates. The thiamine status of the eastern Baltic cod was investigated to determine if thiamine deficiency might be a factor in ongoing population declines. Thiamine concentrations were determined by chemical analyses of thiamine, thiamine monophosphate and thiamine diphosphate (combined SumT) in the liver using high performance liquid chromatography. Biochemical analyses measured the activity of the thiamine diphosphate-dependent enzyme transketolase to determine the proportion of apoenzymes in both liver and brain tissue. These biochemical analyses showed that 77\% of the cod were thiamine deficient in the liver, of which 13\% had a severe thiamine deficiency (i.e. 25\% transketolase enzymes lacked thiamine diphosphate). The brain tissue of 77\% of the cod showed thiamine deficiency, of which 64\% showed severe thiamine deficiency. The thiamine deficiency biomarkers were investigated to find correlations to different biological parameters, such as length, weight, otolith weight, age (annuli counting) and different organ weights. The results suggested that thiamine deficiency increased with age. The SumT concentration ranged between 2.4\textendash 24 nmol/g in the liver, where the specimens with heavier otoliths had lower values of SumT (P = 0.0031). Of the cod sampled, only 2\% of the specimens had a Fulton's condition factor indicating a healthy specimen, and 49\% had a condition factor below 0.8, indicating poor health status. These results, showing a severe thiamine deficiency in eastern Baltic cod from the only known area where spawning presently occurs for this species, are of grave concern.},

To examine the relevance of this equation, we undertook a meta-analysis of published relationships between functional response parameters and temperature. We show that, when plotted in lin-log space, temperature dependence of both attack rate and maximal ingestion rate exhibits a hump-shaped relationship and not a linear one as predicted by the Arrhenius equation. The relationship remains significantly downward concave even when data from temperatures above the peak of the hump are discarded. Temperature dependence is stronger for attack rate than for maximal ingestion rate, but the thermal optima are not different. We conclude that the use of the Arrhenius equation to describe consumption in predator\textendash prey models requires the assumption that temperatures above thermal optima are unimportant for population and community dynamics, an assumption that is untenable given the available data.},

Here we derive a general model of ecosystem respiration based on the kinetics of metabolic reactions11,12,13 and the scaling of resource use by individual organisms14,15. The model predicts that fluxes of CO2 and energy are invariant of ecosystem biomass, but are strongly influenced by temperature, variation in cellular metabolism and rates of supply of limiting resources (water and/or nutrients). Variation in ecosystem respiration within sites, as calculated from a network of CO2 flux towers5,7, provides robust support for the model's predictions. However, data indicate that variation in annual flux between sites is not strongly dependent on average site temperature or latitude. This presents an interesting paradox with regard to the expected temperature dependence. Nevertheless, our model provides a basis for quantitatively understanding energy and material flux between the atmosphere and biosphere.},

Harvesting mature individuals displaces the reaction norm for age and size at maturation toward older ages and larger sizes and rotates it clockwise, whereas harvesting immature individuals has the reverse qualitative effect. If both immature and mature individuals are harvested, the net effect has approximately the same trend as when harvesting immature individuals only. This stems from the sensitivity of the evolutionary response, which depends on the maturity state of harvested individuals, but also on the type of harvest mortality (negatively or positively density dependent, density independent) and the value of three life-history parameters (natural mortality, growth rate and the trade-off between growth and reproduction). Evolutionary changes in the maturation reaction norm have strong repercussions for the mean size and the density of harvested individuals that, in most cases, result in the reduction of biomass\textendash a response that population dynamical models would overlook.

  abstract = {Thermal sensitivity of the cardiorespiratory oxygen supply capacity has been proposed as the cardinal link underlying the upper boundary of the temperature niche in aquatic ectotherms. Here we examined the evidence for this link in two eurythermal decapods, the Giant tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon) and the European crayfish (Astacus astacus). We found that both species have a temperature resistant cardiorespiratory system, capable of maintaining oxygen delivery up to their upper critical temperature (Tcrit). In neither species was Tcrit reduced in hypoxia (60\% air saturation) and both species showed an exponential increase in heart and gill ventilation rates up to their Tcrit. Further, failure of action potential conduction in preparations of A. astacus motor neurons coincided with Tcrit, indicating that compromised nervous function may provide the underlying determinant for Tcrit rather than oxygen delivery. At high temperatures, absolute aerobic scope was maintained in P. monodon, but reduced in A. astacus. However, A. astacus also displayed reduced exercise intensity indicating that impaired muscle performance with resulting reduced tissue oxygen demand may explain the reduced scope rather than insufficient oxygen supply capacity. This interpretation agrees with early literature on aquatic ectotherms, correlating loss of nervous function with impaired locomotion as temperatures approach Tcrit.},

  abstract = {The rapid pace of ocean change has prompted a need to forecast likely future species distributions. Species distribution models are often categorized as either correlative (statistical) or mechanistic, and each has limitations both for advancing understanding and for prediction. Here we sought to benefit from mechanistic understanding of how and why low dissolved oxygen affects species' distributions by applying physiologically informed statistical models to the spatial distribution of sablefish Anoplopoma fimbria, a deep-dwelling commercially important groundfish. We fit spatial models to trawl-survey data on catch rate, local temperature and dissolved oxygen, and estimated parameters of the metabolic index, which provided a way to express the temperature-dependence of oxygen tolerance. We fit generalized linear mixed effects models with Gaussian random fields to capture the latent spatially fixed variables, and included both linear and breakpoint functions for pO2 and the metabolic index. The best fitting models all included breakpoint effects of pO2, and the estimated threshold value of 0.05 atm is close to levels in laboratory studies where metabolism begins to decline. Models based on the metabolic index were not as well supported as those that included pO2, likely because of the decrease in temperature and slight increase in pO2 at deep ({$>$} 800 m) depths. These findings illustrate that statistical models of species distributions can be improved by incorporating knowledge of how physiological mechanisms operate. Furthermore, they illustrate that even species with high tolerance for low dissolved oxygen may undergo species distribution shifts in the face of growing oxygen depletion in coastal ocean ecosystems.},

  abstract = {The von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF) is based on a bioenergetic expression of fish growth; therefore, size-at-age data can theoretically be used to estimate fish consumption rates. We evaluated the accuracy of VBGFderived consumption rates by performing a meta-analysis and sensitivity analysis of VBGF assumptions, and we used Bayesian parameter estimation to quantify uncertainty in these estimates. The VBGF was robust to its assumption regarding the allometry of catabolism but was highly sensitive to the assumed allometry of consumption. Consequently, the commonly used form (``specialized'' VBGF), which makes a strong assumption regarding the allometric slope of consumption, often grossly underestimates ({$>$}50\%) consumption. The precision of the VBGF depended on characteristics of the size-at-age data used to parameterize the model. When data indicate decelerating growth, consumption rates were estimated with good precision; we estimated a 70\% probability that bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) consumption rates were between 1 and 2\% body mass per day. Otherwise, consumption estimates were poorly defined; yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) consumption rates between 2 and 7\% per day were all equally likely. We conclude that VBGF can be a useful tool for estimating fish consumption rates, but potential biases and precision of these estimates should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.},

  abstract = {Forage fish support the largest fisheries in the world but also play key roles in marine food webs by transferring energy from plankton to upper trophic-level predators, such as large fish, seabirds, and marine mammals. Fishing can, thereby, have far reaching consequences on marine food webs unless safeguards are in place to avoid depleting forage fish to dangerously low levels, where dependent predators are most vulnerable. However, disentangling the contributions of fishing vs. natural processes on population dynamics has been difficult because of the sensitivity of these stocks to environmental conditions. Here, we overcome this difficulty by collating population time series for forage fish populations that account for nearly two-thirds of global catch of forage fish to identify the fingerprint of fisheries on their population dynamics. Forage fish population collapses shared a set of common and unique characteristics: high fishing pressure for several years before collapse, a sharp drop in natural population productivity, and a lagged response to reduce fishing pressure. Lagged response to natural productivity declines can sharply amplify the magnitude of naturally occurring population fluctuations. Finally, we show that the magnitude and frequency of collapses are greater than expected from natural productivity characteristics and therefore, likely attributed to fishing. The durations of collapses, however, were not different from those expected based on natural productivity shifts. A risk-based management scheme that reduces fishing when populations become scarce would protect forage fish and their predators from collapse with little effect on long-term average catches.},

Fish responses to various changes in the environment are usually species-dependent, but responses may also vary within species. In general, large individuals are considered to be more sensitive to environmental variation due to higher energy demand, than smaller individuals. Similarly, large individuals require more food to maintain bodily functions and are thus more sensitive to resource and food scarcity. These size-specific responses to environmental gradients are also sex-dependent in species that exhibit sexual size dimorphism (SSD). We studied in enclosures with short-term experiments how rising temperatures and decreasing water transparency regulate the feeding rates of female and male European perch (Perca fluviatilis L.). To explore experimental results, we calculated perch SSD in nine lakes with varying environmental conditions using previously collected field data. The results of the experiments revealed that the combined effect of water transparency and temperature on the feeding rate of fish is gender-dependent: feeding rate of females decreased more than that of males. The experimental results were also supported by field data that revealed a negative relation between water transparency and the magnitude of SSD in perch. Our results suggest that rising temperatures and decreasing water transparency may potentially decrease fish size in a sex-dependent manner. As female size is one of the main demographic traits determining the reproductive success of a fish population, changing environments may have unexpected and far-reaching consequences on fish population dynamics.},

  abstract = {Understanding the recruitment variability of the Atlantic herring North Sea stock remains a key objective of stock assessment and management. Although many efforts have been undertaken linking climatic and stock dynamic factors to herring recruitment, no major attempt has been made to estimate recruitment levels before the 20th century. Here, we present a novel annually resolved, absolutely dated herring recruitment reconstruction, derived from stable carbon isotope geochemistry ({$\delta$}13C), from ocean quahog shells from the Fladen Ground (northern North Sea). Our age model is based on a growth increment chronology obtained from fourteen shells. Ten of these were micromilled at annual resolution for {$\delta$}13C analysis. Our results indicate that the anthropogenically driven relative depletion of 13C, the oceanic Suess effect (oSE), became evident in the northern North Sea in the 1850s. We calculated a regression line between the oSE-d\- etrended {$\delta$}13C results ({$\delta$}13C\.S) and diatom abundance in the North Sea, the regression being mediated by the effect of phytoplankton on the {$\delta$}13C of the ambient dissolved inorganic carbon. We used this regression to build an equation mediated by a nutritional link to reconstruct herring recruitment using {$\delta$}13C\.S. The reconstruction suggests that there were five extended episodes of low-\- recruitment levels before the 20th century. These results are supported by measured recruitment estimates and historical fish catch and export documentation. This work demonstrates that molluscan sclerochronological records can contribute to the investigation of ecological baselines and ecosystem functioning impacted by anthropogenic activity with implications for conservation and stock management.},

  abstract = {1. When exploring spatially complex ecological phenomena using regression models it is often unreasonable to assume a single set of regression coefficients can capture space-varying and scale-dependent relationships between covariates and the outcome variable. This is especially true when conducting analysis across large spatial domains, where there is an increased propensity for anisotropic dependence structures and non-stationarity in the underlying spatial processes. 2. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) and Bayesian spatially-varying coefficients (SVC) are the most common methods for modelling such data. This paper compares these methods for modelling data generated from non-stationary processes. The comparison highlights some strengths and limitations of each method and aims to assist those who seek appropriate methods to better understand spatially complex ecological systems. Both synthetic and ecological data sets are used to facilitate the comparison. 3. Results underscored the need for the postulated model to approximate the underlying mechanism generating the data. Further, results show GWR and SVC can produce very different regression coefficient surfaces and hence dramatically different conclusions can be drawn regarding the impact of covariates. The trade-off between the richer inferential framework of SVC models and computational demands is also discussed.},

  abstract = {In ectotherms, temperature induces similar developmental and evolutionary responses in body size, with larger individuals occurring or evolving in low temperature environments. Based on the occasional occurrence of opposite size clines, showing a decline in body size with increasing latitude, an interaction between generation time and growing season length was suggested to account for the patterns found. Accordingly, multivoltine species with short generation times should gain high compound interest benefits from reproducing early at high temperatures, indicating potential for extra generations, even at the expense of being smaller. This should not apply for obligatorily monovoltine populations. We explicitly test the prediction that monovoltine populations (no compound interest) should be selected for large body size to maximise adult fitness, and therefore size at maturity should respond only weakly to temperature. In two monovoltine populations (an Alpine and a Western German one) of the butterfly Lycaena hippothoe, increasing temperatures had no significant effect on pupal weight and caused a slight decrease in adult weight only. In contrast, two closely related, yet potentially multivoltine Lycaena populations showed a greater weight loss at increasing temperature (in protandrous males, but not in females) and smaller adult sizes throughout. Thus, the results do support our predictions indicating that the compound interest hypothesis may yield causal explanations for the relationship between temperature and insect size at maturity. At all temperatures, the alpine population had higher growth rates and concomitantly shorter development times (not accompanied by a reduction in size) than the other, presumably indicating local adaptations to different climates.},

  abstract = {Fishing is a strong selective force and is supposed to select for earlier maturation at smaller body size. However, the extent to which fishing-induced evolution is shaping ecosystems remains debated. This is in part because it is challenging to disentangle fishing from other selective forces (e.g., size-structured predation and cannibalism) in complex ecosystems undergoing rapid change. Changes in maturation size from fishing and predation have previously been explored with multi-species physiologically structured models but assumed separation of ecological and evolutionary timescales. To assess the eco-evolutionary impact of fishing and predation at the same timescale, we developed a stochastic physiologically size-structured food-web model, where new phenotypes are introduced randomly through time enabling dynamic simulation of species' relative maturation sizes under different types of selection pressures. Using the model, we carried out a fully factorial in silico experiment to assess how maturation size would change in the absence and presence of both fishing and predation (including cannibalism). We carried out ten replicate stochastic simulations exposed to all combinations of fishing and predation in a model community of nine interacting fish species ranging in their maximum sizes from 10 g to 100 kg. We visualized and statistically analyzed the results using linear models. The effects of fishing on maturation size depended on whether or not predation was enabled and differed substantially across species. Fishing consistently reduced the maturation sizes of two largest species whether or not predation was enabled and this decrease was seen even at low fishing intensities (F = 0.2 per year). In contrast, the maturation sizes of the three smallest species evolved to become smaller through time but this happened regardless of the levels of predation or fishing. For the four medium-size species, the effect of fishing was highly variable with more species showing significant and larger fishing effects in the presence of predation. Ultimately our results suggest that the interactive effects of predation and fishing can have marked effects on species' maturation sizes, but that, at least for the largest species, predation does not counterbalance the evolutionary effect of fishing. Our model also produced relative maturation sizes that are broadly consistent with empirical estimates for many fish species.},

  abstract = {1. The temperature-size rule (TSR) is a widespread phenomenon, which describes the phenotypic plastic response of species' size to temperature: individuals reared at colder temperatures mature as larger adults than at warmer temperatures. 2. The TSR is driven by an unequal thermal response of growth and development rates. However, we currently lack an understanding of how these rates change through ontogeny and their decoupling. Further, we do not know how this decoupling varies across generations. 3. Using the brine shrimp Artemia franciscana as a model, we examine growth and development rates through ontogeny at different temperatures across two generations. 4. The slopes of natural-logged weight-specific growth rates against temperature are steeper in earlier than later larval stages, indicating their greater temperature dependence, whereas development rates maintain the same temperature dependence across life stages. An inverse TSR is generated in early larval stages; the typical TSR (smaller size at warmer temperatures) is only established later in ontogeny. 5. Phase-specific temperature dependence of growth and development rates is not significantly different across the 1st and 2nd generation, suggesting the TSR is primarily a within-generation outcome. 6. Ontogenetic size responses in Artemia are compared to other crustacean species to identify patterns within this subphylum. Data for a range of crustaceans follow the same ontogenetic pattern: early larval stages show an inverse or no TSR, with TSR being only established in later stages. Adults often, but not always, show the greatest response.},

  abstract = {Most ectothermic organisms mature at smaller body sizes when reared in warmer conditions. This phenotypically plastic response, known as the "temperature-size rule" (TSR), is one of the most taxonomically widespread patterns in biology. However, the TSR remains a longstanding life-history puzzle for which no dominant driver has been found. We propose that oxygen supply plays a central role in explaining the magnitude of ectothermic temperature-size responses. Given the much lower oxygen availability and greater effort required to increase uptake in water vs. air, we predict that the TSR in aquatic organisms, especially larger species with lower surface area-body mass ratios, will be stronger than in terrestrial organisms. We performed a meta-analysis of 1,890 body mass responses to temperature in controlled experiments on 169 terrestrial, freshwater, and marine species. This reveals that the strength of the temperature-size response is greater in aquatic than terrestrial species. In animal species of {$\sim$}100 mg dry mass, the temperature-size response of aquatic organisms is 10 times greater than in terrestrial organisms (-5.0\% \textdegree C(-1) vs. -0.5\% \textdegree C(-1)). Moreover, although the size response of small ({$<$}0.1 mg dry mass) aquatic and terrestrial species is similar, increases in species size cause the response to become increasingly negative in aquatic species, as predicted, but on average less negative in terrestrial species. These results support oxygen as a major driver of temperature-size responses in aquatic organisms. Further, the environment-dependent differences parallel latitudinal body size clines, and will influence predicted impacts of climate warming on food production, community structure, and food-web dynamics.},

The variational properties of b have been debated, but very few studies have tested for genetic variance in b, and none have tested for a genotype-by-environment (G\texttimes E) interaction in b. Consequently, the short-term evolutionary potentials of both b and its phenotypic plasticity remain unknown. Using 10 clones of a population of Daphnia magna, we estimated the genetic variance in b and assessed whether a G\texttimes E interaction affected b. We measured MR on juveniles of different sizes reared and measured at three temperatures (17, 22 and 28\textdegree C). Overall, b decreased with increasing temperature. We found no evidence of genetic variance in b at any temperature, and thus no G\texttimes E interaction in b. However, we found a significant G\texttimes E interaction in size-specific MR. Using simulations, we show how this G\texttimes E interaction can generate genetic variation in the ontogenetic allometric slope of animals experiencing directional changes in temperature during growth. This suggests that b can evolve despite having limited genetic variation at constant temperatures.},

Also, this survey, conducted in 2004, was the first to make extensive use of DNA-based molecular methods to unambiguously identify early developmental stage cod eggs. We compare the findings from the plankton survey with estimated egg production inferred from the distribution of mature cod in contemporaneous trawl surveys. Results from both approaches were in general agreement and showed hot spots of egg production around the southern and eastern edges of the Dogger Bank, in the German Bight, the Moray Firth and to the east of the Shetlands. These areas broadly coincide with known spawning locations from the period 1940 to 1970. We were, however, unable to directly detect significant numbers of cod eggs at the historic spawning ground off Flamborough (northeast coast of England). The results demonstrate that most of the major spawning grounds of cod in the North Sea are still active but that some localized populations may have been reduced to the point where it is now difficult to detect the presence of eggs in the plankton.},

  abstract = {Climate change triggers poleward shifts in species distribution leading to changes in biogeography. In the marine environment, fish respond quickly to warming, causing community-wide reorganizations, which result in profound changes in ecosystem functioning. Functional biogeography provides a framework to address how ecosystem functioning may be affected by climate change over large spatial scales. However, there are few studies on functional biogeography in the marine environment, and none in the Arctic, where climate-driven changes are most rapid and extensive. We investigated the impact of climate warming on the functional biogeography of the Barents Sea, which is characterized by a sharp zoogeographic divide separating boreal from Arctic species. Our unique dataset covered 52 fish species, 15 functional traits, and 3,660 stations sampled during the recent warming period. We found that the functional traits characterizing Arctic fish communities, mainly composed of small-sized bottom-dwelling benthivores, are being rapidly replaced by traits of incoming boreal species, particularly the larger, longer lived, and more piscivorous species. The changes in functional traits detected in the Arctic can be predicted based on the characteristics of species expected to undergo quick poleward shifts in response to warming. These are the large, generalist, motile species, such as cod and haddock. We show how functional biogeography can provide important insights into the relationship between species composition, diversity, ecosystem functioning, and environmental drivers. This represents invaluable knowledge in a period when communities and ecosystems experience rapid climate-driven changes across biogeographical regions.},

In particular, the von Bertalanffy parameter l{$\infty$} means asymptotic mean length at age for age\textendash length data, and maximum length for tagging data, when estimated by conventional methods. New parameterizations are given for the von Bertalanffy equation which avoid this ambiguity and better represent the growth information in the two types of data. The comparison between growth estimates from these data sets is shown to be equivalent to comparing the mean growth rate of fish of a given age with that of fish of length equal to the mean length at that age. How much these growth rates may differ in real populations remains unresolved: estimates for two species of fish produced markedly different results, neither of which could be reproduced using growth models. Existing growth models are shown to be inadequate to answer this question.},

By assembling published data from studies in exploited North Atlantic ecosystems, we found pronounced geographical variation in top-down and bottom-up trophic forcing. The data suggest that ecosystem susceptibility to top-down control and their resiliency to exploitation are related to species richness and oceanic temperature conditions.

We analyzed annual range edge dynamics of marine fishes\textemdash both at the individual species level and pooled into cold- and warm-edge assemblages\textemdash in a multi-decade time-series of trawl surveys conducted on the Northeast US Shelf during a period of rapid warming. We tested whether cold edges show stronger evidence of climate tracking than warm edges (due to non-climate processes or time lags at the warm edge; the biogeography hypothesis or extinction debt hypothesis), or whether they tracked temperature change equally (due to the influence of habitat suitability; the ecophysiology hypothesis). In addition to exploring correlations with regional temperature change, we calculated species- and assemblage-specific sea bottom and sea surface temperature isotherms and used them to predict range edge position. Cold edges shifted further and tracked sea surface and bottom temperature isotherms to a greater degree than warm edges. Mixed-effects models revealed that for a one-degree latitude shift in isotherm position, cold edges shifted 0.47 degrees of latitude, and warm edges shifted only 0.28 degrees. Our results suggest that cold range edges are tracking climate change better than warm range edges, invalidating the ecophysiology hypothesis. We also found that even among highly mobile marine ectotherms in a global warming hotspot, few species are fully keeping pace with climate.},

However, few studies to date have analyzed time series of range edge positions in the context of climate change, in part because range edges are difficult to detect. We first quantified positions for 165 range edges of marine fishes and invertebrates from three U.S. continental shelf regions using up to five decades of survey data and a spatiotemporal model to account for sampling and measurement variability. We then analyzed whether those range edges maintained their edge thermal niche\textemdash the temperatures found at the range edge position\textemdash over time. A large majority of range edges (88\%) maintained either summer or winter temperature extremes at the range edge over the study period, and most maintained both (76\%), although not all of those range edges shifted in space. However, we also found numerous range edges\textemdash particularly poleward edges and edges in the region that experienced the most warming\textemdash that did not shift at all, shifted further than predicted by temperature alone, or shifted opposite the direction expected, underscoring the multiplicity of factors that drive changes in range edge positions.

In many parts of the world, forage fish fisheries are managed using precautionary principles that target catch limits below the maximum sustainable yield. However, there are increasing calls to further limit forage fish catch to safeguard their fish, seabird, and marine mammal predators. The effectiveness of these extra-precautionary regulations, which assume that increasing prey abundance increases predator productivity, are under debate. In this study, we used prey-linked population models to measure the influence of forage fish abundance on the population growth rates of 45 marine predator populations representing 32 fish, seabird, and mammal species from 5 regions around the world. We used simulated data to confirm the ability of the statistical model to accurately detect prey influences under varying levels of influence strength and process variability. Our results indicate that predator productivity was rarely influenced by the abundance of their forage fish prey. Only 6 predator populations (13\% of the total) were positively influenced by increasing prey abundance and the model exhibited high power to detect prey influences when they existed. These results suggest that additional limitation of forage fish harvest to levels well below sustainable yields would rarely result in detectable increases in marine predator populations.},

We compared the magnitude and variance of shifts at species' warm versus cool limits, and quantified how range shifts have impacted species' elevational extents and areas. Results On average species have shifted upslope associated with temperature increases at both warm and cool limits (warm limit: 92 {$\pm$} 455 m/C; cool limit: 131 {$\pm$} 465 m/C; overall mean {$\pm$} SD). There was no systematic difference in the magnitude or variance of shifts at warm versus cool limits and thus no indication that cool limits are more directly controlled by temperature. Species' elevational extents and available area significantly decreased for mountaintop species. Main conclusions Our results do not support the long-standing hypothesis that cool limits are more sensitive or responsive to temperature. We find that, across the globe, mountaintop species' ranges are significantly shrinking as they shift upslope, supporting predictions that high elevation species are especially vulnerable to temperature increases. Our synthesis highlights the extreme variation in species' distributional responses to warming, which may indicate that biotic interactions play a more prominent role in setting range limits than previously thought.},

  abstract = {Understanding responses of marine species to temperature variability is essential to predict impacts of future climate change in the oceans. Most ectotherms are expected to adjust their behavior to avoid extreme temperatures and minimize acute changes in body temperature. However, measuring such behavioral plasticity in the wild is challenging. Combining 4 years of telemetry-derived behavioral data on juvenile and adult (30-80 cm) Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), and in situ ocean temperature measurements, we found a significant effect of sea temperature on cod depth use and activity level in coastal Skagerrak. During summer, cod were found in deeper waters when sea surface temperature increased. Further, this effect of temperature was stronger on larger cod. Diel vertical migration, which consists in a nighttime rise to shallow feeding habitats, was stronger among smaller cod. As surface temperature increased beyond approximately 15 degrees C, their vertical migration was limited to deeper waters. In addition to larger diel vertical migrations, smaller cod were more active and travelled larger distances compared to larger specimens. Cold temperatures during winter tended, however, to reduce the magnitude of diel vertical migrations, as well as the activity level and distance moved by those smaller individuals. Our findings suggest that future and ongoing rises in sea surface temperature may increasingly deprive cod in this region from shallow feeding areas during summer, which may be detrimental for local populations of the species.},

There was a general lack of basic information on temperature tolerance and sensitivity for many species. Available data indicated that the ranges in tolerable temperatures were positively related to optimal growth temperatures. However, no clear relationships with temperature sensitivity were established and no clear differences between pelagic and demersal species were observed. The analysis was complicated by the fact that for pelagic species, experimental data were completely absent and even for well-studied species, information was incomplete and sometimes contradictory. Nevertheless, differences in life-history strategies were clearly reflected in parameter differences between related species. Two approaches were used in the estimation of DEB parameters: one based on the assumption that reserve hardly contributes to physical volume; the other does not make this assumption, but relies on body-size scaling relationships, using parameter values of a generalized animal as pseudo-data. Temperature tolerance and sensitivity seemed to be linked with the energetics of a species. In terms of growth, relatively high temperature optima, sensitivity and/or tolerance were related to lower relative assimilation rates as well as lower maintenance costs. Making the step from limited observations to underlying mechanisms is complicated and extrapolations should be carefully interpreted. Special attention should be devoted to the estimation of parameters using body-size scaling relationships predicted by the DEB theory.},

  abstract = {Body size is a fundamental functional trait that can be used to forecast individuals' responses to environmental change and their contribution to ecosystem functioning. However, information on the mean and variation of size distributions often confound one another when relating body size to aggregate functioning. Given that size-based metrics are used as indicators of ecosystem status, it is important to identify the specific aspects of size distributions that mediate ecosystem functioning. Our goal was to simultaneously account for the mean, variance, and shape of size distributions when relating body size to aggregate ecosystem functioning. We take advantage of habitat-specific differences in size distributions to estimate nutrient recycling by a non-native crayfish using mean-field and variance-incorporating approaches. Crayfishes often substantially influence ecosystem functioning through their omnivorous role in aquatic food webs. As predicted from Jensen's inequality, considering only the mean body size of crayfish overestimated aggregate effects on ecosystem functioning. This bias declined with mean body size such that mean-field and variance-incorporating estimates of ecosystem functioning were similar for samples at mean body sizes {$>$}7.5 g. At low mean body size, mean-field bias in ecosystem functioning mismatch predictions from Jensen's inequality, likely because of the increasing skewness of the size distribution. Our findings support the prediction that variance around the mean can alter the relationship between body size and ecosystem functioning, especially at low mean body size. However, methods to account for mean-field bias performed poorly in samples with highly skewed distributions, indicating that changes in the shape of the distribution, in addition to the variance, may confound mean-based estimates of ecosystem functioning. Given that many biological functions scale allometrically, explicitly defining and experimentally or statistically isolating the effects of the mean, variance, and shape of size distributions is necessary to begin generalizing relationships between animal body size and ecosystem functioning.},

Such fishing is proposed to result in higher catches with less negative impact on exploited populations and ecosystems. This study examines the models and the empirical evidence put forward in support of BH. It finds that the models used unrealistic settings with regard to life history (peak of cohort biomass at small sizes), response to fishing (strong compensation of fishing mortality by reduced natural mortality), and economics (uniform high cost of fishing and same ex-vessel price for all species and sizes), and that empirical evidence of BH is scarce and questionable. It concludes that evolutionary theory, population dynamics theory, ecosystem models with realistic assumptions and settings, and widespread empirical evidence do not support the BH proposal. Rather, this body of evidence suggests that BH will not help but will hinder the policy changes needed for the rebuilding of ecosystems, healthy fish populations, and sustainable fisheries.},

The historical review traces the developments of the respective concepts. The meta-analysis explores 3929 weight\textendash length relationships of the type W = aLb for 1773 species of fishes. It shows that 82\% of the variance in a plot of log a over b can be explained by allometric versus isometric growth patterns and by different body shapes of the respective species. Across species median b = 3.03 is significantly larger than 3.0, thus indicating a tendency towards slightly positive-allometric growth (increase in relative body thickness or plumpness) in most fishes. The expected range of 2.5 {$<$} b {$<$} 3.5 is confirmed. Mean estimates of b outside this range are often based on only one or two weight\textendash length relationships per species. However, true cases of strong allometric growth do exist and three examples are given. Within species, a plot of log a vs b can be used to detect outliers in weight\textendash length relationships. An equation to calculate mean condition factors from weight\textendash length relationships is given as Kmean = 100aLb-3. Relative weight Wrm = 100W/(amLbm) can be used for comparing the condition of individuals across populations, where am is the geometric mean of a and bm is the mean of b across all available weight\textendash length relationships for a given species.

  abstract = {In ectotherms, anthropogenic warming often increases energy requirements for metabolism, which can either impair growth (when resources are limiting) or lead to higher predator feeding rates and possibly stronger top\textendash down trophic interactions. However, the relative importance of these effects in nature remains unclear because: (1) thermal adaptation or acclimation could lower metabolic costs; (2) greater prey production at warmer temperatures could compensate for higher predator feeding rates; and/or (3) temperature effects on trophic interactions via altered biological rates could be small relative to other, temperature-unrelated human impacts on food webs. Here, we examined effects of deforestation-associated warming on the minnow Enteromius neumayeri, occurring in both forested (cool) and deforested (warm) streams located inside or nearby an afrotropical rainforest. Combining approaches from physiological and community ecology, we quantified impacts of anthropogenic warming on the metabolism, growth and trophic interactions of this tropical ectotherm. We then compared these effects with impacts of land use unrelated to temperature. In a long-term laboratory acclimation experiment quantifying the temperature dependence of growth and metabolism in E. neumayeri, warming increased metabolic rates and decreased growth (at a limited ration). We found no evidence of local (thermal) adaptation, with warming affecting farm and forest populations similarly. Then, using mark\textendash recapture methods to quantify impacts of warming on performance in situ, we found similar growth rates in fish from deforested and forested streams despite their distinct thermal environments. This suggests higher prey consumption at deforested sites to compensate for greater metabolic costs, which could strengthen fish\textendash invertebrate interactions. Finally, we developed a bioenergetics model to estimate fish\textendash invertebrate interaction strength and quantify temperature-related and unrelated impacts of land use on this interaction. We found that although warming increased fish consumption, it apparently increased invertebrate production even more and thus had a net-weakening effect on estimated interaction strength. Most importantly, variation in both fish and invertebrate density not directly related to temperature had a much stronger influence on estimated interaction strength than temperature effects on predator consumption and prey growth. We conclude that ectotherms can sometimes offset the metabolic costs of warming with a small increase in consumption that hardly effects food web interactions compared to non-metabolic impacts of anthropogenic disturbances. Future research should assess whether this is a common feature of heavily impacted ecosystems facing multiple stressors. A plain language summary is available for this article.},

Together, our results indicate a major change in how we expect climate change to alter natural ecosystems: warming should increase population stability while undermining species diversity. Ongoing},

  abstract = {The performance of species distribution models (SDMs) is known to be affected by analysis grain and positional error of species occurrences. Coarsening of the analysis grain has been suggested to compensate for positional errors. Nevertheless, this way of dealing with positional errors has never been thoroughly tested. With increasing use of fine-scale environmental data in SDMs, it is important to test this assumption. Models using fine-scale environmental data are more likely to be negatively affected by positional error as the inaccurate occurrences might easier end up in unsuitable environment. This can result in inappropriate conservation actions. Here, we examined the trade-offs between positional error and analysis grain and provide recommendations for best practice. We generated narrow niche virtual species using environmental variables derived from LiDAR point clouds at 5 \texttimes{} 5 m fine-scale. We simulated the positional error in the range of 5 m to 99 m and evaluated the effects of several spatial grains in the range of 5 m to 500 m. In total, we assessed 49 combinations of positional accuracy and analysis grain. We used three modelling techniques (MaxEnt, BRT and GLM) and evaluated their discrimination ability, niche overlap with virtual species and change in realized niche. We found that model performance decreased with increasing positional error in species occurrences and coarsening of the analysis grain. Most importantly, we showed that coarsening the analysis grain to compensate for positional error did not improve model performance. Our results reject coarsening of the analysis grain as a solution to address the negative effects of positional error on model performance. We recommend fitting models with the finest possible analysis grain and as close to the response grain as possible even when available species occurrences suffer from positional errors. If there are significant positional errors in species occurrences, users are unlikely to benefit from making additional efforts to obtain higher resolution environmental data unless they also minimize the positional errors of species occurrences. Our findings are also applicable to coarse analysis grain, especially for fragmented habitats, and for species with narrow niche breadth.},

Here we present one such approach, the ``biological ensemble modeling approach,'' using the Eastern Baltic cod (Gadus morhua callarias) as an example. The core of the approach is to expose an ensemble of models with different ecological assumptions to climate forcing, using multiple realizations of each climate scenario. We simulated the long-term response of cod to future fishing and climate change in seven ecological models ranging from single-species to food web models. These models were analyzed using the ``biological ensemble modeling approach'' by which we (1) identified a key ecological mechanism explaining the differences in simulated cod responses between models, (2) disentangled the uncertainty caused by differences in ecological model assumptions from the statistical uncertainty of future climate, and (3) identified results common for the whole model ensemble. Species interactions greatly influenced the simulated response of cod to fishing and climate, as well as the degree to which the statistical uncertainty of climate trajectories carried through to uncertainty of cod responses. Models ignoring the feedback from prey on cod showed large interannual fluctuations in cod dynamics and were more sensitive to the underlying uncertainty of climate forcing than models accounting for such stabilizing predator\textendash prey feedbacks. Yet in all models, intense fishing prevented recovery, and climate change further decreased the cod population. Our study demonstrates how the biological ensemble modeling approach makes it possible to evaluate the relative importance of different sources of uncertainty in future species responses, as well as to seek scientific conclusions and sustainable management solutions robust to uncertainty of food web processes in the face of climate change.},

Evolution of maturation size in response to size-dependent selection is thus a fundamental part of life-history theory. Increased mortality among small individuals has previously been predicted to cause larger maturation size, whereas increased mortality among large individuals is expected to have the opposite effect. Here we use a continuously size-structured model to demonstrate that, contrary to these widespread expectations, increased mortality among small individuals can have three alternative effects: maturation size may increase, decrease or become evolutionarily bistable. We show that such complex responses must be reckoned with whenever mortality is size-dependent, growth is indeterminate, reproduction impairs growth and fecundity increases with size. Predicting adaptive responses to altered size-dependent mortality is thus inherently difficult, since, as demonstrated here, such mortality cannot only reverse the direction of adaptation, but also cause abrupt shifts in evolutionarily stable maturation sizes.}

  abstract = {Understanding food web responses to global warming, and their consequences for conservation and management, requires knowledge on how responses vary both among and within species. Warming can reduce both species richness and biomass production. However, warming responses observed at different levels of biological organization may seem contradictory. For example, higher temperatures commonly lead to faster individual body growth but can decrease biomass production of fishes. Here we show that the key to resolve this contradiction is intraspecific variation, because (i) community dynamics emerge from interactions among individuals, and (ii) ecological interactions, physiological processes and warming effects often vary over life history. By combining insights from temperature-dependent dynamic models of simple food webs, observations over large temperature gradients and findings from short-term mesocosm and multi-decadal whole-ecosystem warming experiments, we resolve mechanisms by which warming waters can affect food webs via individual-level responses and review their empirical support. We identify a need for warming experiments on food webs manipulating population size structures to test these mechanisms. We stress that within-species variation in both body size, temperature responses and ecological interactions are key for accurate predictions and appropriate conservation efforts for fish production and food web function under a warming climate.This article is part of the theme issue `Integrative research perspectives on marine conservation'.},

Probabilistic programming languages make it easier to specify and fit Bayesian models, but this still leaves us with many options regarding constructing, evaluating, and using these models, along with many remaining challenges in computation. Using Bayesian inference to solve real-world problems requires not only statistical skills, subject matter knowledge, and programming, but also awareness of the decisions made in the process of data analysis. All of these aspects can be understood as part of a tangled workflow of applied Bayesian statistics. Beyond inference, the workflow also includes iterative model building, model checking, validation and troubleshooting of computational problems, model understanding, and model comparison. We review all these aspects of workflow in the context of several examples, keeping in mind that in practice we will be fitting many models for any given problem, even if only a subset of them will ultimately be relevant for our conclusions.},

Our methods are simple and generally applicable to the output of any iterative simulation; they are designed for researchers primarily interested in the science underlying the data and models they are analyzing, rather than for researchers interested in the probability theory underlying the iterative simulations themselves. Our recommended strategy is to use several independent sequences, with starting points sampled from an overdispersed distribution. At each step of the iterative simulation, we obtain, for each univariate estimand of interest, a distributional estimate and an estimate of how much sharper the distributional estimate might become if the simulations were continued indefinitely. Because our focus is on applied inference for Bayesian posterior distributions in real problems, which often tend toward normality after transformations and marginalization, we derive our results as normal-theory approximations to exact Bayesian inference, conditional on the observed simulations. The methods are illustrated on a random-effects mixture model applied to experimental measurements of reaction times of normal and schizophrenic patients.},

  abstract = {Most models of fish growth and predation dynamics assume that food ingestion rate is the major component of the energy budget affected by prey availability, while active metabolism is invariant (here called constant activity hypothesis). However, increasing empirical evidence supports an opposing view: fish tend to adjust their foraging activity to maintain reasonably constant ingestion levels in the face of varying prey density and/or quality (the constant satiation hypothesis). In this paper, we use a simple but flexible model of fish bioenergetics to show that constant satiation is likely to occur in fish that optimize both net production rate and life history. The model includes swimming speed as an explicit measure of foraging activity leading to both energy gains (through prey ingestion) and losses (through active metabolism). The fish is assumed to be a particulate feeder that has to swim between consecutive individual prey captures, and that shifts its diet ontogenetically from smaller to larger prey. The prey community is represented by a negative power-law size spectrum. From these rules, we derive the net production of fish as a function of the size spectrum, and this in turn establishes a formal link between the optimal life history (i.e. maximum body size) and prey community structure. In most cases with realistic parameter values, optimization of life history ensures that: (i) a constantly satiated fish preying on a steep size spectrum will stop growing and invest all its surplus energy in reproduction before satiation becomes too costly; (ii) conversely, a fish preying on a shallow size spectrum will grow large enough for satiation to be present throughout most of its ontogeny. These results provide a mechanistic basis for previous empirical findings, and call for the inclusion of active metabolism as a major factor limiting growth potential and the numerical response of predators in theoretical studies of food webs. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Because many ecological rates are constrained by temperature, new approaches are required to understand how simultaneous changes in multiple rates alter the relative performance of species and their trophic interactions. We develop an energetic approach to identify the relationship between biomass fluxes and standing biomass across trophic levels. Our approach links ecological rates and trophic dynamics to measure temperature-dependent changes to the strength of trophic interactions and determine how these changes alter food web stability. It accomplishes this by using biomass as a common energetic currency and isolating three temperature-dependent processes that are common to all consumer-resource interactions: biomass accumulation of the resource, resource consumption and consumer mortality. Using this framework, we clarify when and how temperature alters consumer to resource biomass ratios, equilibrium resilience, consumer variability, extinction risk and transient vs. equilibrium dynamics. Finally, we characterise key asymmetries in species responses to temperature that produce these distinct dynamic behaviours and identify when they are likely to emerge. Overall, our framework provides a mechanistic and more unified understanding of the temperature dependence of trophic dynamics in terms of ecological rates, biomass ratios and stability.},

Differences in the timing of evolutionary events estimated from genetic and fossil evidence have raised further questions about the accuracy of molecular clocks. Here, we present a model of nucleotide substitution that combines theory on metabolic rate with the now-classic neutral theory of molecular evolution. The model quantitatively predicts rate heterogeneity and may reconcile differences in molecular- and fossil-estimated dates of evolutionary events. Model predictions are supported by extensive data from mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. By accounting for the effects of body size and temperature on metabolic rate, this model explains heterogeneity in rates of nucleotide substitution in different genes, taxa, and thermal environments. This model also suggests that there is indeed a single molecular clock, as originally proposed by Zuckerkandl and Pauling [Zuckerkandl, E. \& Pauling, L. (1965) in Evolving Genes and Proteins, eds. Bryson, V. \& Vogel, H. J. (Academic, New York), pp. 97-166], but that it "ticks" at a constant substitution rate per unit of mass-specific metabolic energy rather than per unit of time. This model therefore links energy flux and genetic change. More generally, the model suggests that body size and temperature combine to control the overall rate of evolution through their effects on metabolism.},

We use this principle and a size-based equilibrium model where asymptotic length is used as a functional trait to investigate how natural mortality should scale with size within and across pelagic and demersal species of North Sea teleosts. The model predicts natural mortality to scale with body length raised to a power of 21.66 at current levels of exploitation. Additionally, natural mortality of demersal species should be proportional to asymptotic length raised to a power of 0.80, so generating a higher natural mortality at a given length for large species than for small ones. The model also suggests that the exponent in the scaling of the von Bertalanffy growth parameter K with asymptotic length should be more negative for pelagic than for demersal species. We test our results by analysing independent estimates of predation mortality, the scaling of maximum recruitment per unit of spawning-stock biomass with asymptotic length, and the general relationship between K and asymptotic length for demersal and pelagic families of fish. All tests are consistent with our modelling results.},

  abstract = {The natural mortality of exploited fish populations is often assumed to be a speciesspecific constant independent of body size. This assumption has important implications for size-based fish population models and for predicting the outcome of sizedependent fisheries management measures such as mesh-size regulations. To test the assumption, we critically review the empirical estimates of the natural mortality, M (year)1), of marine and brackish water fish stocks and model them as a function of von Bertalanffy growth parameters, L\textyen{} (cm) and K (year)1), temperature (Kelvin) and length, L (cm). Using the Arrhenius equation to describe the relationship between M and temperature, we find M to be significantly related to length, L\textyen{} and K, but not to temperature (R2 = 0.62, P {$<$} 0.0001, n = 168). Temperature and K are significantly correlated and when K is removed from the model the temperature term becomes significant, but the resulting model explains less of the total variance (R2 = 0.42, P {$<$} 0.0001, n = 168). The relationships between M, L, L\textyen, K and temperature are shown to be in general accordance with previous theoretical and empirical investigations. We conclude that natural mortality is significantly related to length and growth characteristics and recommend to use the empirical formula: ln(M) = 0.55 ) 1.61ln(L) + 1.44ln(L\textyen ) + ln(K), for estimating the natural mortality of marine and brackish water fish.},

  abstract = {In this review I show that the '3/4-power scaling law' of metabolic rate is not universal, either within or among animal species. Significant variation in the scaling of metabolic rate with body mass is described mainly for animals, but also for unicells and plants. Much of this variation, which can be related to taxonomic, physiological, and/or environmental differences, is not adequately explained by existing theoretical models, which are also reviewed. As a result, synthetic explanatory schemes based on multiple boundary constraints and on the scaling of multiple energy-using processes are advocated. It is also stressed that a complete understanding of metabolic scaling will require the identification of both proximate (functional) and ultimate (evolutionary) causes. Four major types of intraspecific metabolic scaling with body mass are recognized [based on the power function R=aMb, where R is respiration (metabolic) rate, a is a constant, M is body mass, and b is the scaling exponent]: Type I: linear, negatively allometric (b\textbackslash textless1); Type II: linear, isometric (b=1); Type III: nonlinear, ontogenetic shift from isometric (b=1), or nearly isometric, to negatively allometric (b\textbackslash textless1); and Type IV: nonlinear, ontogenetic shift from positively allometric (b\textbackslash textgreater1) to one or two later phases of negative allometry (b\textbackslash textless1). Ontogenetic changes in the metabolic intensity of four component processes (i.e. growth, reproduction, locomotion, and heat production) appear to be important in these different patterns of metabolic scaling. These changes may, in turn, be shaped by age (size)-specific patterns of mortality. In addition, major differences in interspecific metabolic scaling are described, especially with respect to mode of temperature regulation, body-size range, and activity level. A 'metabolic-level boundaries hypothesis' focusing on two major constraints (surface-area limits on resource/waste exchange processes and mass/volume limits on power production) can explain much, but not all of this variation. My analysis indicates that further empirical and theoretical work is needed to understand fully the physiological and ecological bases for the considerable variation in metabolic scaling that is observed both within and among species. Recommended approaches for doing this are discussed. I conclude that the scaling of metabolism is not the simple result of a physical law, but rather appears to be the more complex result of diverse adaptations evolved in the context of both physico-chemical and ecological constraints.},

However, the metabolic scaling exponent (b) may vary with activity state, as has been shown chiefly for interspecific relationships. Here I use a meta-analysis of literature data to test whether b changes with activity level within species of ectothermic animals. Data for 19 species show that b is usually higher during active exercise (mean +/- 95\% confidence limits = 0.918 +/- 0.038) than during rest (0.768 +/- 0.069). This significant upward shift in b to near 1 is consistent with the metabolic level boundaries hypothesis, which predicts that maximal metabolic rate during exercise should be chiefly influenced by volume-related muscular power production (scaling as M (1)). This dependence of b on activity level does not appear to be a simple temperature effect because body temperature in ectotherms changes very little during exercise.},

However, substantial variation in the metabolic scaling exponent (b) exists, much of which can be related to the overall metabolic level (L) of various taxonomic groups of organisms, as predicted by the recently proposed metabolic-level boundaries (MLB) hypothesis. Here the MLB hypothesis was tested using data for intraspecific (ontogenetic) body-mass scaling of resting metabolic rate in spiders and boid snakes. As predicted, in both animal groups b varies mostly between 2/3 and 1, and is significantly negatively related to L. L is, in turn, negatively related to species-specific body mass (M(m): estimated as the mass at the midpoint of a scaling relationship), and as a result, larger species tend to have steeper metabolic scaling slopes (b) than smaller species. After adjusting for the effects of M(m), b and L are still negatively related, though significantly only in the spiders, which exhibit a much wider range of L than the snakes. Therefore, in spiders and snakes the intraspecific scaling of metabolic rate with body mass itself scales with interspecific variation in both metabolic level and body mass.},

  abstract = {The scaling of metabolic rate with body mass has long been a controversial topic. Some workers have claimed that the slope of log-log metabolic scaling relationships typically obeys a universal 3/4-power law resulting from the geometry of resource-transport networks. Others have attempted to explain the broad diversity of metabolic scaling relationships. Although several potentially useful models have been proposed, at present none successfully predicts the entire range of scaling relationships seen among both physiological states and taxonomic groups of animals and plants. Here I argue that our understanding may be aided by three shifts in focus: from explaining average tendencies to explaining variation between extreme boundary limits, from explaining the slope and elevation (metabolic level) of scaling relationships separately to showing how and why they are interrelated, and from focusing primarily on internal factors (e.g. body design) to a more balanced consideration of both internal and external (ecological) factors. By incorporating all of these shifts in focus, the recently proposed metabolic-level boundaries hypothesis appears to provide a useful way of explaining both taxonomic and physiological variation in metabolic scaling relationships. This hypothesis correctly predicts that the scaling slope should vary mostly between 2/3 and 1 and that it should be related to metabolic (activity) level according to an approximately U-shaped function. It also implies that the scaling of other energy-dependent biological processes should be related to the metabolic level of the organisms being examined. Some data are presented that support this implication, but further research is needed.},

  abstract = {Body size has widely been recognized as one of the most important determinants of organismal form and function (1). Extremes in size can be especially illuminating of the drivers and constraints in body size evolution, and marine mammals provide a remarkable set of test cases because their independent invasions of the sea have produced a stunning array of sizes, from sea otters to blue whales that span several orders of magnitude in body mass. Why should whales have become so huge and why aren't they larger? One scale-dependent physiological process that may shed light on these questions relates to energy flux: how animals obtain energy from the environment and how they use stored energy (2). Although larger animals have higher absolute metabolic requirements than smaller ones, the rates are not proportional to body size (3). The negative allometry of metabolic rate, whereby larger animals exhibit lower mass-specific rates of metabolism, confers a suite of physiological and ecological benefits at greater body sizes. These advantages include a low cost of transport (4); enhanced fasting ability (5); and, for air-breathers in aquatic environments, the ability to dive longer and deeper in search of food (6). There is a tendency of many vertebrate lineages to increase body size through time, but the environmental drivers and physiological constraints of body size evolution remain poorly understood. In PNAS, Gearty et al. (7) analyze the evolution of body size in several independent mammalian lineages that underwent land-to-sea transitions in their evolutionary histories. They use comparative phylogenetic analyses and an examination of the fossil record to test several hypotheses that attempt to explain why mammals evolved larger size in aquatic ecosystems. Physical and energetic constraints on maximum body size are a common theme in several previously proposed hypotheses regarding the phenomenon of large mammals in the ocean. \ldots{}  [{$\carriagereturn$}][1]1Email: jergold\{at\}stanford.edu.

However, there is increasing interest in moving beyond a single-species focus to understand how species redistribution alters ecosystem dynamics via changes in trophic interactions. We employed spatiotemporal models to characterize decadal-scale changes in spatial overlap between the distribution of juvenile walleye pollock Gadus chalcogrammus and the distributions of four of its groundfish predators: arrowtooth flounder Atheresthes stomias, Pacific cod Gadus macrocephalus, Pacific halibut Hippoglossus stenolepis and adult walleye pollock. These fishes represent ecologically and commercially important species in a rapidly changing sub-Arctic ecosystem, the eastern Bering Sea, Alaska, USA. We then examined whether changes in spatial overlap corresponded to changes in predation, using spatiotemporal models of predator stomach contents. We found marked shifts in spatial overlap between juvenile pollock and two predators (arrowtooth flounder and Pacific halibut) over 34 years, with changes in overlap corresponding to increases in population-scale predation pressure. By contrast, we did not find clear relationships between spatial overlap and predation for Pacific cod and adult pollock, the two predators for which juvenile pollock constitute a much smaller diet proportion. Our findings highlight the complexity of predicting predation dynamics for generalist marine species and suggest a need for better process-based methods for understanding the potential future ecological impacts of coupled species range shifts. However, simple metrics of spatial overlap between relatively specialized predators and their prey offer promise as a means to integrate predictions from species distribution models into ecosystem-based fisheries management.},

Assessing food web response to altered habitats is addressed by Descriptor 4 and its indicators, which are being developed for regional seas. However, the development of simple foodweb indicators able to assess the health of ecologically diverse, spatially variable and complex interactions is challenging. Zooplankton is a key element in marine foodwebs and thus comprise an important part of overall ecosystem health. Here, we review work on zooplankton indicator development using long-term data sets across the Baltic Sea and report the main findings. A suite of zooplankton community metrics were evaluated as putative ecological indicators that track community state in relation to Good Environmental Status (GES) criteria with regard to eutrophication and fish feeding conditions in the Baltic Sea. On the basis of an operational definition of GES, we propose mean body mass of zooplankton in the community in combination with zooplankton stock measured as either abundance or biomass to be applicable as an integrated indicator that could be used within the Descriptor 4 in the Baltic Sea. These metrics performed best in predicting zooplankton being in-GES when considering all datasets evaluated. However, some other metrics, such as copepod biomass, the contribution of copepods to the total zooplankton biomass or biomass-based Cladocera: Copepoda ratio, were equally reliable or even superior in certain basin-specific assessments. Our evaluation suggests that in several basins of the Baltic Sea, zooplankton communities currently appear to be out-of-GES, being comprised by smaller zooplankters and having lower total abundance or biomass compared to the communities during the reference conditions; however, the changes in the taxonomic structure underlying these trends vary widely across the sea basins due to the estuarine character of the Baltic Sea.},

  abstract = {Climate-induced coral bleaching is among the greatest current threats to coral reefs, causing widespread loss of live coral cover. Conditions under which reefs bounce back from bleaching events or shift from coral to algal dominance are unknown, making it difficult to predict and plan for differing reef responses under climate change. Here we document and predict long-term reef responses to a major climate-induced coral bleaching event that caused unprecedented region-wide mortality of Indo-Pacific corals. Following loss of \textbackslash textgreater90\% live coral cover, 12 of 21 reefs recovered towards pre-disturbance live coral states, while nine reefs underwent regime shifts to fleshy macroalgae. Functional diversity of associated reef fish communities shifted substantially following bleaching, returning towards pre-disturbance structure on recovering reefs, while becoming progressively altered on regime shifting reefs. We identified threshold values for a range of factors that accurately predicted ecosystem response to the bleaching event. Recovery was favoured when reefs were structurally complex and in deeper water, when density of juvenile corals and herbivorous fishes was relatively high and when nutrient loads were low. Whether reefs were inside no-take marine reserves had no bearing on ecosystem trajectory. Although conditions governing regime shift or recovery dynamics were diverse, pre-disturbance quantification of simple factors such as structural complexity and water depth accurately predicted ecosystem trajectories. These findings foreshadow the likely divergent but predictable outcomes for reef ecosystems in response to climate change, thus guiding improved management and adaptation.},

  abstract = {The complexity of food webs can be reduced to fundamental modules of trophic interactions that repeat to form reticulate webs. Omnivory, defined as feeding on more than one trophic level, is a module that is found in food webs more often than predicted by chance, likely because it confers stability. Yet, little is known about how omnivore and other food web modules affect individuals in the food web. Here, we constructed four different experimental food web modules using a blue mussel predator, zooplankton consumer, and phytoplankton resource. By manipulating the predator's access to the consumer and providing resource subsidies, we produced exploitative competition, food chain and omnivory food web modules, and a consumer-resource interaction. We used RNA:DNA ratios to measure the growth rate of the consumer in each food web. In 24-h experiments, growth rates of the consumer in the omnivory food web were significantly higher and more variable than in the other modules. Our results suggest that higher growth rates and variation at the individual scale may weaken the strength of predator\textendash consumer interactions and help explain the ubiquity of omnivory in real food webs.},

Whilst the ecological effects of these changes are poorly understood, it has been suggested that fish performance including growth will be reduced mainly as a result of limitations in oxygen transport capacity. Contrary to the predictions given by the oxygen- and capacity-limited thermal tolerance hypothesis, we show that aerobic scope and cardiac performance of Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) increase following 14-16 weeks exposure to elevated temperatures and even more so in combination with CO2-acidified seawater. However, the increase does not translate into improved growth, demonstrating that oxygen uptake is not the limiting factor for growth performance at high temperatures. Instead, long-term exposure to CO2-acidified seawater reduces growth at temperatures that are frequently encountered by this species in nature, indicating that elevated atmospheric CO2 levels may have serious implications on fish populations in the future.},

Salinity characterized the transition from shelf to slope water, with isopycnals sloping vertically, seaward, and shoaling at the thermocline. A frontal feature defined by the convergence of isopycnals and a surface temperature gradient was sampled inshore of the shallowest zone of the shelf-slope front. Zooplankton and larval fishes were abundant on the shelf side of the front and displayed taxon-dependent depth distributions but were rare in the slope waters. Supervised automated particle counting showed small particles with high solidity, verified to be zooplankton (copepods and appendicularians), aggregating near surface above the front. Salps were most abundant in zones of intermediate chlorophyll-a fluorescence, distinctly separate from high abundances of other grazers and found almost exclusively in colonial form (97.5\%). Distributions of gelatinous zooplankton differed among taxa but tended to follow isopycnals. Fine-scale sampling revealed distinct habitat partitioning of various planktonic taxa, resulting from a balance of physical and biological drivers in relation to the front.},

We use the high resolution regional coupled ocean\textendash sea ice\textendash atmosphere model RCA4\textendash NEMO to downscale an ensemble of five global climate projections with a main focus on the Baltic Sea and neighboring shelf basins to the west. We find consistently across the ensemble a northward shift in the mean summer position of the westerlies at the end of the twenty-first century compared to the twentieth century. Associated with this is an anomalous precipitation pattern marked by increased rainfall over northern Europe and dryer conditions over the continental central part. In response to these large-scale atmospheric changes, a strong freshening mainly resulting from a higher net precipitation over the year combined with higher annual mean runoff is registered for the Baltic Sea and adjacent seas. The strongest freshening takes place in the southern Skagerrak region where stronger winds enhance the cyclonic circulation and by this, recirculation of fresher waters from the Baltic Sea strengthens. In the Baltic Sea freshening leads to a reduction in basin averaged salinities between 0.6 and 2.3 g kg-1 throughout the ensemble. Likewise, the sea surface temperature response in the Baltic Sea varies between + 2.5 and + 4.7 K depending on the applied global model scenario. The climate induced changes in atmospheric forcing have further consequences for the large-scale circulation in the Baltic Sea. All ensemble members indicate a strengthening of the zonal, wind driven near surface overturning circulation in the southwestern Baltic Sea towards the end of the twenty-first century whereas the more thermohaline driven overturning at depth is reduced by \textasciitilde{} 25\%. In the Baltic Proper, the meridional overturning shows no clear climate change signal. However, three out of five ensemble members indicate at least a northward expansion of the main overturning cell. In the Bothnian Sea, all ensemble members show a significant weakening of the meridional overturning. The entire ensemble consistently indicates a basin-wide intensification of the pycnocline (9\textendash 35\%) for the Baltic Sea and a shallowing of the pycnocline depth in most regions as well. In the Baltic Sea, which is dominated by mesohaline conditions under the historical period, the changes in salinity at the end of the twenty-first century have turned wide areas to be dominated by oligohaline conditions as a result of climate change. Potential consequences for biogeochemical conditions and implications for biodiversity are discussed.},

  abstract = {Every year, countless juvenile Pacific salmon leave streams and rivers on their migration to feeding grounds in the North Pacific Ocean and the Bering Sea. After periods ranging from a few months to several years, adult salmon enter rivers along the coasts of Asia and North America to spawn and complete their life cycle. Within this general outline, various life history patterns, both among and within species, involve diverse ways of exploiting freshwater, estuarine, and marine habitats. There are seven species of Pacific salmon. Five (coho, chinook chum, pink, and sockeye) occur in both North America and Asia. Their complex life histories and spectacular migrations have long fascinated biologists and amateurs alike. Physiological Ecology of Pacific Salmon provides comprehensive reviews by leading researchers of the physiological adaptations that allow Pacific Salmon to sustain themselves in the diverse environments in which they live. It begins with an analysis of energy expenditure and continues with reviews of locomotion, growth, feeding, and nutrition. Subsequent chapters deal with osmotic adjustments enabling the passage between fresh and salt water, nitrogen excretion and regulation of acid-base balance, circulation and gas transfer, and finally, responses to stress. This thorough and authoritative volume will be a valuable reference for students and researchers of biology and fisheries science as they seek to understand the environmental requirements for the perpetuation of these unique and valuable species.},

  abstract = {Estimating fish condition, the relative weight of an individual fish given its body length, is a convenient way to relate the physiological health and energetic status of fishes to their productivity. Despite evidence of density-dependence effects on condition in some species, previous research has not jointly estimated synchronous changes in condition and density operating at fine spatial scales (a few km). Therefore, we developed a spatio-temporal modeling approach that simultaneously estimates correlated variation in density (measured as numbers per area) and condition. We applied our approach to 6 eastern Bering Sea (EBS) groundfish species (4 flatfishes and 2 gadoids) for the period 1992-2016, and estimated correlations in spatial variation (unmeasured variation that is stable over time) and spatio-temporal variation (unmeasured variation that changes between years). Spatial variation in density had a strong significant negative association with spatial variation in condition for 3 flatfishes and a positive association for one gadoid. Spatiotemporal variation in density had a significant association with spatio-temporal variation in condition for one flatfish (negative) and one gadoid (positive). Moreover, for the 6 study species, bottom temperature was identified as an important predictor of both density and condition. The increasing trend in bottom temperatures between 1992 and 2016 was accompanied by an overall increase in the abundance-weighted condition of 5 species. We conclude that forecasts of changes in weight-at-age within some EBS groundfish assessments will require an understanding of both density-dependence and bottom temperature effects on fish condition to better prepare for future climate and exploitation changes.},

  abstract = {Ecosystem-based fisheries-management (EBFM) is increasingly used in the United States (U.S.), including in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM). Producing distribution maps for marine organisms is a critical step in the implementation of EBFM. In particular, distribution maps are important inputs for many spatially-explicit ecosystem models, such as OSMOSE models, as well as for biophysical models used to predict annual recruitment anomalies due to oceanographic factors. In this study, we applied a recently proposed statistical modelling framework to produce distribution maps for: (i) younger juveniles (ages 0\textendash 1) of red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus), red grouper (Epinephelus morio), and gag (Mycteroperca microlepis), so as to be able to define the potential larval settlement areas of the three species in a biophysical model; and (ii) the functional groups and life stages represented in the OSMOSE model of the West Florida Shelf (``OSMOSE-WFS''). This statistical modelling framework consists of: (i) compiling a large database blending all of the encounter/non-encounter data of the GOM collected by the fisheries-independent and fisheries-dependent surveys using random sampling schemes, referred to as the ``comprehensive survey database;'' (ii) employing the comprehensive survey database to fit spatio-temporal binomial generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) that integrate the confounding effects of survey and year; and (iii) using the predictions of the fitted spatio-temporal binomial GLMMs to generate distribution maps. This large endeavour allowed us to produce distribution maps for younger juveniles of red snapper, red grouper and gag and nearly all of the other functional groups and life stages represented in OSMOSE-WFS, at different seasons. Using Pearson residuals, the probabilities of encounter predicted by all spatio-temporal binomial GLMMs were demonstrated to be reasonable. Moreover, the results obtained for younger juvenile fish concur with the literature, provide additional insights into the spatial distribution patterns of these life stages, and highlight important future research avenues.},

However, there is no statistical method for processing stomach content data that accounts for fine-scale spatio-temporal structure while expanding individual stomach samples to population-level estimates of predation. Therefore, we developed an approach that fits a spatio-temporal model to both prey-biomass-per-predator-biomass data (i.e. the ratio of prey biomass in stomachs to predator weight) and predator biomass survey data, to predict ``predator-expanded-stomach-contents'' (PESCs). PESC estimates can be used to visualize either the annual landscape of PESCs (spatio-temporal variation), or can be aggregated across space to calculate annual variation in diet proportions (variation among prey items and among years). We demonstrated our approach in two contrasting scenarios: a data-rich situation involving eastern Bering Sea (EBS) large-size walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus, Gadidae) for 1992\textendash 2015; and a data-limited situation involving West Florida Shelf red grouper (Epinephelus morio, Epinephelidae) for 2011\textendash 2015. Large walleye pollock PESC was predicted to be higher in very warm years on the Middle Shelf of the EBS, where food is abundant. Red grouper PESC was variable in north-western Florida waters, presumably due to spatio-temporal variation in harmful algal bloom severity. Our approach can be employed to parameterize or validate diverse ecosystem models, and can serve to address many fundamental ecological questions, such as providing an improved understanding of how climate-driven changes in spatial overlap between predator and prey distributions might influence predation pressure.},

  abstract = {Attributing variability in fish demographic processes to environmental conditions is helpful when assessing population status and forecasting changes in ecosystem function. Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis has long been used to explore variability in physical processes, but has been only recently employed to study variability in biological processes. EOF analysis estimates dominant modes of variability (indices) and produces maps representing the spatial response for the dependent variable to each of these indices. In the eastern Bering Sea (EBS), research has linked demographic processes to the spatial extent of bottom temperatures less than or equal to 2~\textdegree C (the ``cold-pool extent'' or ``CPE''), but has generally not compared effects among different demographic processes. We applied EOF analysis to four types of data measuring the outcome of demographic processes for EBS walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) over the period 1982\textendash 2019: numerical density (outcome of movement), morphometric condition (outcome of bioenergetics), length-at-age (outcome of growth), and prey-biomass-per-predator-mass (a proxy for stomach contents; outcome of consumption). We first designed exploratory factor analysis (EFA) models that did not include a CPE effect. We then applied confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), which differed from EFA by attributing observed patterns to a spatially varying response of demographic processes to CPE. We inferred that CPE was a proxy for demographic variability when there was a strong correlation between (1) the first or second mode of variability in the EFA and CPE or (2) the spatial map associated with the positive phase of the first or second mode of variability from the EFA model and the spatially varying response of CPE from the CFA model. Results showed that prey-biomass-per-predator-mass had the strongest correlation with CPE, numerical density and morphometric condition were also strongly correlated with CPE, and length-at-age was moderately correlated with CPE. The models also identified several anomalous years: 1999 and 2010, which were characterized by a very large CPE and high indices for variables related to demographic processes; and 2016\textendash 2019, which were characterized by a small CPE and low indices for variables related to demographic processes. We conclude that demographic processes for EBS walleye pollock show the finger-print of bottom-up environmental variation. Future research can employ CPE projections to forecast spatio-temporal changes in variables related to demographic processes, thereby informing estimates such as weight-at-age that are used in stock assessment models.},

  abstract = {Ecosystems can show sudden and persistent changes in state despite only incremental changes in drivers. Such critical transitions are difficult to predict, because the state of the system often shows little change before the transition. Early-warning indicators (EWIs) are hypothesized to signal the loss of system resilience and have been shown to precede critical transitions in theoretical models, paleo-climate time series, and in laboratory as well as whole lake experiments. The generalizability of EWIs for detecting critical transitions in empirical time series of natural aquatic ecosystems remains largely untested, however. Here we assessed four commonly used EWIs on long-term datasets of five freshwater ecosystems that have experienced sudden, persistent transitions and for which the relevant ecological mechanisms and drivers are well understood. These case studies were categorized by three mechanisms that can generate critical transitions between alternative states: competition, trophic cascade, and intraguild predation. Although EWIs could be detected in most of the case studies, agreement among the four indicators was low. In some cases, EWIs were detected considerably ahead of the transition. Nonetheless, our results show that at present, EWIs do not provide reliable and consistent signals of impending critical transitions despite using some of the best routinely monitored freshwater ecosystems. Our analysis strongly suggests that a priori knowledge of the underlying mechanisms driving ecosystem transitions is necessary to identify relevant state variables for successfully monitoring EWIs.},

  abstract = {Physical and biogeochemical changes of the oceans have complex influences on fish communities. Variations of resource and temperature affect metabolic rates at the individual level, biomass fluxes at the species level, and trophic structure as well as diversity at the community level. We use a Dynamic Energy Budget-, trait-based model of the consumers' community size-spectrum to assess the effects of lower trophic level biomass and water temperature on communities at steady state. First, we look at the stressors separately in idealized simulations, varying one while the second remains constant. A multi-domain response is observed. Linked to the number of trophic levels sustained in the consumers' community, the regimes highlighted present similar properties when lower trophic level biomass is increased or temperature decreased. These trophic-length domains correspond to different efficiencies of the transfer of biomass from small to large individuals. They are characterized by different sensitivities of fish communities to environmental changes. Moreover, differences in the scaling of individuals' metabolism and prey assimilation with temperature lead to a shrinking of fish communities with warming. In a second step, we look at the impact of simultaneous variations of stressors along a mean latitudinal gradient of lower trophic level biomass and temperature. The model explains known observed features of global marine ecosystems such as the fact that larger species compose fish communities when latitude increases. The structure, diversity and metabolic properties of fish communities obtained with the model at different latitudes are interpreted in light of the different trophic-length domains characterized in the idealized experiments. From the equator to the poles, the structure of consumers' communities is predicted to be heterogeneous, with variable sensitivities to environmental changes.},

  abstract = {The regularity of the community size-spectrum, i.e., the fact that the total ecosystem biomass contained in logarithmically equal body size intervals remains constant, is a striking characteristic of marine ecosystems. Community size-spectrum models exploit this feature to represent marine ecosystems with two measures: the slope and the intercept (height) of the community spectrum. Size-spectrum models have gain popularity over time to model the properties of fish communities, whether to investigate the impact of fishing, or embedded into end-to-end models to investigate the impact of climate. We review the main features and state of the art developments in the domain of continuous size-spectrum models. The community spectrum emerges from a balance between size-selective predation, growth and biomass dissipation. Further to these basic components, reproduction and various causes of mortality have been introduced in recent studies to increase the model's realism or simply close the mass budget of the spectrum. These different processes affect the stability of the spectrum and affect the predictions of the size-spectrum models. A few models have also introduced a representation of life-history traits in the community size-spectrum. This allows accounting for the diversity of energy pathways in food webs and for the fact that metabolism is both size- and species-specific. The community-level metabolism therefore depends on the species composition of the community. The size-spectrum's regularity at the community level can serve as a conceptual basis for building theories of marine ecosystems' functioning. It is also used as indicator of anthropogenic and natural disturbances. The mechanistic nature of size-spectrum models as well as their simple and aggregated representation of complex systems makes them good candidates as a strategic management tool. For instance, for testing the impact of different fishing management actions or for projecting marine ecosystem's states under various climate change scenarios.},

  abstract = {One billion people depend on seafood as their primary source of protein and 25\% of the world's total animal protein comes from fisheries. Yet a third of fish stocks worldwide are overexploited or depleted. Using individual case studies, many have argued that community-based co-management should prevent the tragedy of the commons because cooperative management by fishers, managers and scientists often results in sustainable fisheries. However, general and multidisciplinary evaluations of co-management regimes and the conditions for social, economic and ecological success within such regimes are lacking. Here we examine 130 co-managed fisheries in a wide range of countries with different degrees of development, ecosystems, fishing sectors and type of resources. We identified strong leadership as the most important attribute contributing to success, followed by individual or community quotas, social cohesion and protected areas. Less important conditions included enforcement mechanisms, long-term management policies and life history of the resources. Fisheries were most successful when at least eight co-management attributes were present, showing a strong positive relationship between the number of these attributes and success, owing to redundancy in management regulations. Our results demonstrate the critical importance of prominent community leaders and robust social capital, combined with clear incentives through catch shares and conservation benefits derived from protected areas, for successfully managing aquatic resources and securing the livelihoods of communities depending on them. Our study offers hope that co-management, the only realistic solution for the majority of the world's fisheries, can solve many of the problems facing global fisheries.},

To understand species interactions, studies of feeding habits are required. In the Baltic Sea, there is good knowledge of the diet of cod, but little is known about the diet of flounder, the second most abundant demersal fish in the region. In this study, we investigated the diets of cod and flounder for the first time using stomach content data collected simultaneously in 2015-2017 over a large offshore area of the southern Baltic Sea. The diet of flounder was relatively constant between sizes and seasons and was dominated by benthos, with a high proportion in weight of the benthic isopod Saduria entomon. The diet of cod differed between seasons and showed an ontogenetic shift with a relative decrease of benthic prey and an increase of fish prey with size. Historic diet data of cod were used to explore cod diet changes over time, revealing a shift from a specialized to generalist feeding mode paralleled by a large relative decline in benthic prey, especially S. entomon. Flounder populations have increased in the past 2 decades in the study area, and therefore we hypothesized that flounder have deprived cod of important benthic resources through competition. This competition could be exacerbated by the low benthic prey productivity due to increased hypoxia, which could contribute to explaining the current poor status of the Eastern Baltic cod. The results of this study point to the importance of including flounder in multispecies end ecosystem models.},

This is of particular concern when reviews address policy- and practice-relevant questions. Systematic reviews have been introduced as a more rigorous approach to synthesizing evidence across studies; they rely on a suite of evidence-based methods aimed at maximizing rigour and minimizing susceptibility to bias. Despite the increasing popularity of systematic reviews in the environmental field, evidence synthesis methods continue to be poorly applied in practice, resulting in the publication of syntheses that are highly susceptible to bias. Recognizing the constraints that researchers can sometimes feel when attempting to plan, conduct and publish rigorous and comprehensive evidence syntheses, we aim here to identify major pitfalls in the conduct and reporting of systematic reviews, making use of recent examples from across the field. Adopting a `critical friend' role in supporting would-be systematic reviews and avoiding individual responses to police use of the `systematic review' label, we go on to identify methodological solutions to mitigate these pitfalls. We then highlight existing support available to avoid these issues and call on the entire community, including systematic review specialists, to work towards better evidence syntheses for better evidence and better decisions. Systematic reviews are a powerful tool to synthesize large volumes of the published literature, but are susceptible to a number of methodological biases. Here, the authors outline mitigation strategies for improving the quality of evidence syntheses.},

Aerobic scope data can be presented in absolute or factorial terms (AAS or FAS, respectively). However, the robustness of these calculations to noise or variability in measures of metabolic rate can influence subsequent interpretations of patterns in the data. We explored this issue using simple models and we compared the predictions from these models to experimental data from the literature. First, we investigated the robustness of aerobic scope calculations as a function of varying SMR when MMR is fixed, and vice versa. While FAS is unexpectedly robust to variability in SMR, even in species with low aerobic scopes, AAS is less sensitive to variation in SMR than is FAS. However, where variation in MMR is the main concern, FAS is more robust than AAS. Our findings highlight the equal importance of minimising variability in MMR, rather than just the variability in SMR, to obtain robust aerobic scope estimates. Second, we analysed metabolic rate accounting for locomotor speed and body mass for swimming fish. The interactions among these factors in relation to AAS and FAS are complex and the appropriate metric is dependent on the specific eco-physiological context of the research question. We conclude with qualified recommendations for using and interpreting AAS and FAS.},

Low oxygen reduced juvenile growth rate, mature size, clutch size, neonate body size, and neonatal neckteeth development; the effects depended on size at birth (neonate size), with a stronger influence on smaller neonates. The kairomone and carbaryl had similar effects, apart from the effect on neonatal neckteeth development, which was enhanced. In all treatments, positive relationships were found between individual body size and clutch size, mother's body size and neonate size, and neonate size and neonatal neckteeth development. The most important effect of the environmental factors is probably reduction in juvenile growth rate. Reduced growth rate induced small size at maturation and thus smaller adult sizes, leading to smaller clutch sizes and producing smaller neonates, which had poorer neckteeth. Synergism was detected statistically for the effects of any pair of the three factors and of all together, indicating that one factor reduces tolerance to the other factors.},

Oceanic conditions influence Atlantic bluefin tuna distribution and it has been hypothesized that stock distributions have shifted in recent years. Distributional shifts can affect regional availability and fleet catchability, introducing a potential bias in fisheries dependent data used for indexing population trends. We developed a vector auto-regressive spatio-temporal model (VAST) to estimate changes in bluefin tuna spatial distribution in US waters and created standardized indices of abundance for large ({$>$}177~cm) and small size classes ({$\leq$} 177~cm) of fish. Local-scale environmental factors (sea surface temperature (SST), ocean depth) and regional-scale drivers (e.g., Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and prey biomass) of spatial distribution were explored. Results indicated that from 1993 to 2020, spatial distribution of the larger size class was highly variable, but on average, the total estimated area occupied increased by 96~km2/year and the center of gravity shifted 2~km/year north and 3~km/year east. Results were similar for the smaller size class fish with an average increase in area occupied of 71~km2/year. The center of gravity shifted an average of 1~km/year north and 2~km/year east. The primary factor driving the spatial shifts for both large and small fish was local-scale SST. Standardized indices of abundance were produced and incorporated SST as a covariate of local density. In comparison to prior standardization results, spatio-temporal indices demonstrated less inter-annual variability and produced similar overall trends. This study advanced our understanding of bluefin tuna spatial distributions and generated indices of relative abundance in US waters of the Northwest Atlantic that are more robust to spatio-temporal changes in tuna distributions for consideration in future stock assessments.},

  abstract = {Anthropogenically induced global climate change has profound implications for marine ecosystems and the economic and social systems that depend upon them. The relationship between temperature and individual performance is reasonably well understood, and much climate-related research has focused on potential shifts in distribution and abundance driven directly by temperature. However, recent work has revealed that both abiotic changes and biological responses in the ocean will be substantially more complex. For example, changes in ocean chemistry may be more important than changes in temperature for the performance and survival of many organisms. Ocean circulation, which drives larval transport, will also change, with important consequences for population dynamics. Furthermore, climatic impacts on one or a few 'leverage species' may result in sweeping community-level changes. Finally, synergistic effects between climate and other anthropogenic variables, particularly fishing pressure, will likely exacerbate climate-induced changes. Efforts to manage and conserve living marine systems in the face of climate change will require improvements to the existing predictive framework. Key directions for future research include identifying key demographic transitions that influence population dynamics, predicting changes in the community-level impacts of ecologically dominant species, incorporating populations' ability to evolve (adapt), and understanding the scales over which climate will change and living systems will respond.},

  abstract = {This thesis sets out a food web framework for size-structured populations. The framework enables an ecological approach to food web modelling as the individual life-history from birth, through maturation, and ultimately death is explicitly resolved with the use of bioenergetics based on individual body size. Each population resolves size-structure through a size-spectrum containing the individual abundance as a continuous function of body size. Individuals select prey items of a suitable size, which can be popularised as ``big ones eat smaller ones''. This allows individuals to change diet throughout life (life-history omnivory). In the framework individual food consumption leads to growth in body size and allocation to reproduction, which drives the population dynamics as opposed to instantaneous population increase in unstructured food web models. Paper I introduces the framework and shows how a simple realistic parametrisation is possible when a trait-based species characterisation is used. An analytical approximation of the food web framework is derived, and validated through comparison with dynamic simulations. Paper II extends the dynamic framework by also considering space, and demonstrates how large food webs can be formed through sequential community assembly. The resulting communities resemble the topology of natural food webs as well as complying with empirical data on diversity and biomass distributions \textendash{} demonstrating that individual-level food encounter and prey-selection from the rule ``big ones eat smaller ones'' lead to complex and realistic food webs. Paper III uses the analytical solution of the framework to show the conditions under which the many-small-eggs strategy of the fishes is a viable strategy. Paper IV utilises the trait-based species description to show that coexisting species pairs involved in intraguild predation exist for all resource levels. The model thus explains empirically observed coexistence at high resource levels contrary to contemporary theoretical models. Paper V demonstrates how harvesting initiates a trophic cascade that may propagate both downwards and upwards in trophic levels, and that the harvesting pattern may influence whether or not trophic cascades are empirically detected. In Paper VI the analytical solution is used to provide a theoretical understanding of empirically observed relationships between natural mortality, growth, and production rates.},

  abstract = {We synthesise traditional unstructured food webs, allometric body size scaling, trait-based modelling, and physiologically structured modelling to provide a novel and ecologically relevant tool for sizestructured food webs. The framework allows food web models to include ontogenetic growth and life-history omnivory at the individual level by resolving the population structure of each species as a sizespectrum. Each species is characterised by the trait `size at maturation', and all model parameters are made species independent through scaling with individual body size and size at maturation. Parameter values are determined from cross-species analysis of fish communities as life-history omnivory is widespread in aquatic systems, but may be reparameterised for other systems. An ensemble of food webs is generated and the resulting communities are analysed at four levels of organisation: community level, species level, trait level, and individual level. The model may be solved analytically by assuming that the community spectrum follows a power law. The analytical solution provides a baseline expectation of the results of complex food web simulations, and agrees well with the predictions of the full model on biomass distribution as a function of individual size, biomass distribution as a function of size at maturation, and relation between predator\textendash prey mass ratio of preferred and eaten food. The full model additionally predicts the diversity distribution as a function of size at maturation.},

We analyse size spectra with co-located fish and mobile macroinvertebrate data from 3369 reef sites worldwide, specifically focusing on how the addition of invertebrate data alters patterns. The inclusion of invertebrates steepens the size spectrum, more so in temperate regions, resulting in a consistent size spectrum slope across latitudes, and bringing slopes closer to theoretical expectations based on energy flow through the system. These results highlight the importance of understanding contributions of both invertebrates and fishes to reef food webs worldwide.},

All life-history traits except L{$\varrho$} were significantly correlated with latitude. In general, growth rates, mortality rates, and reproductive investment decreased with latitude, whereas age at maturity, size at maturity, and life span increased with latitude. Populations could be grouped into two categories based on variation in L{$\varrho$}: stunted (small sized) vs. piscivorous (large sized). Four trait\textendash latitude relationships differed between these two types: the growth coefficient (K ) and the juvenile growth rate were larger, and age and length at maturity were lower in the stunted populations compared with piscivorous populations. Perch from southern populations tend to grow fast and experience high juvenile and adult mortality rates. As predicted from life-history theory, this selects for an early age and small size at maturity and relatively large investment in reproduction. The opposite pattern was found for northern populations. Key words: latitudinal cline; life-history variation; trade-offs; Perca fluviatilis L.; perch.},

For the Eastern Baltic Sea cod stock (Gadus morhua), unclear seasonal growth zones in otoliths have resulted in unreliable age and growth information. Here, a new age estimation method based on seasonal patterns in trace elemental otolith incorporation was tested for the first time and compared with the traditional method of visually counting growth zones, using otoliths from the Baltic and North seas. Various trace elemental ratios, linked to fish metabolic activity (higher in summer) or external environment (migration to colder, deeper habitats with higher salinity in winter), were tested for age estimation based on assessing their seasonal variations in concentration. Mg:Ca and P:Ca, both proxies for growth and metabolic activity, showed greatest seasonality and therefore have the best potential to be used as chemical clocks. Otolith image readability was significantly lower in the Baltic than in the North Sea. The chemical (novel) method had an overall greater precision and percentage agreement among readers (11.2\%, 74.0\%) than the visual (traditional) method (23.1\%, 51.0\%). Visual readers generally selected more highly contrasting zones as annuli whereas the chemical readers identified brighter regions within the first two annuli and darker zones thereafter. Visual estimates produced significantly higher, more variable ages than did the chemical ones. Based on the analyses in our study, we suggest that otolith microchemistry is a promising alternative ageing method for fish populations difficult to age, such as the Eastern Baltic cod.},

To better understand these shifts, many processes need to be considered, yet they are often approached from incompatible perspectives. This article reviews one relatively simple, integrated perspective: the abundance-size spectrum. We introduce the topic with a brief review of some of the ways climate change is expected to impact the marine ecosystem according to complex numerical models while acknowledging the limits to understanding posed by complex models. We then review how the size spectrum offers a simple conceptual alternative, given its regular power law size-frequency distribution when viewed on sufficiently broad scales. We further explore how anticipated physical aspects of climate change might manifest themselves through changes in the elevation, slope and regularity of the size spectrum, exposing mechanistic questions about integrated ecosystem structure, as well as how organism physiology and ecological interactions respond to multiple climatic stressors. Despite its application by ecosystem modellers and fisheries scientists, the size spectrum perspective is not widely used as a tool for monitoring ecosystem adaptation to climate change, providing a major opportunity for further research.},

  abstract = {Climate change is warming the ocean and impacting lower trophic level (LTL) organisms. Marine ecosystem models can provide estimates of how these changes will propagate to larger animals and impact societal services such as fisheries, but at present these estimates vary widely. A better understanding of what drives this inter-model variation will improve our ability to project fisheries and other ecosystem services into the future, while also helping to identify uncertainties in process understanding. Here, we explore the mechanisms that underlie the diversity of responses to changes in temperature and LTLs in eight global marine ecosystem models from the Fisheries and Marine Ecosystem Model Intercomparison Project (FishMIP). Temperature and LTL impacts on total consumer biomass and ecosystem structure (defined as the relative change of small and large organism biomass) were isolated using a comparative experimental protocol. Total model biomass varied between -35\% to +3\% in response to warming, and -17\% to +15\% in response to LTL changes. There was little consensus about the spatial redistribution of biomass or changes in the balance between small and large organisms (ecosystem structure) in response to warming, an LTL impacts on total consumer biomass varied depending on the choice of LTL forcing terms. Overall, climate change impacts on consumer biomass and ecosystem structure are well approximated by the sum of temperature and LTL impacts, indicating an absence of nonlinear interaction between the models' drivers. Our results highlight a lack of theoretical clarity about how to represent fundamental ecological mechanisms, most importantly how temperature impacts scale from individual to ecosystem level, and the need to better understand the two-way coupling between LTL organisms and consumers. We finish by identifying future research needs to strengthen global marine ecosystem modelling and improve projections of climate change impacts.},

  abstract = {The evidence for an equal distribution of biomass from bacteria to whales has led to development of size-spectrum models that represent the dynamics of the marine ecosystem using size rather than species identity. Recent advances have improved the realism of the fish component of the size-spectrum, but these often assume that small fish feed on an aggregated plankton size-spectrum, without any explicit representation of zooplankton dynamics. In these models, small zooplankton are grouped with phytoplankton as a resource for larval fish, and large zooplankton are parameterized as small fish. Here, we investigate the impact of resolving zooplankton and their feeding traits in a dynamic size-spectrum model. First, we compare a base model, where zooplankton are parameterized as smaller fish, to a model that includes zooplankton-specific feeding parameters. Second, we evaluate how the parameterization of zooplankton feeding characteristics, specifically the predator\textendash prey mass ratio (PPMR), assimilation efficiency and feeding kernel width, affects the productivity and stability of the fish community. Finally, we compare how feeding characteristics of different zooplankton functional groups mediate increases in primary production and fishing pressure. Incorporating zooplankton-specific feeding parameters increased productivity of the fish community, but also changed the dynamics of the entire system from a stable to an oscillating steady-state. The inclusion of zooplankton feeding characteristics mediated a trade-off between the productivity and resilience of the fish community, and its stability. Fish communities with increased productivity and lower stability were supported by zooplankton with a larger PPMR and a narrower feeding kernel\textendash specialized herbivores. In contrast, fish communities that were stable had lower productivity, and were supported by zooplankton with a lower PPMR and a wider feeding kernel\textemdash generalist carnivores. Herbivorous zooplankton communities were more efficient at mediating increases in primary production, and supported fish communities more resilient to fishing. Our results illustrate that zooplankton are not just a static food source for larger organisms,nor can they be resolved as very small fish. The unique feeding characteristics of zooplankton have enormous implications for the dynamics of marine ecosystems, and their representation is of critical importance in size-spectrum models, and end-to-end ecosystem models more broadly.},

However, pupfish acclimated to ecologically relevant temperatures may employ extended periods of anaerobism despite the availability of oxygen\textemdash a process we called paradoxical anaerobism. In this study, we evaluated data from pupfish exhibiting stable oxygen consumption. Routine oxygen consumption ({$\mkern1mu$}RVO2{$\mkern1mu$}) of a refuge population derived from Cyprinodon spp. acclimated to 28 and 33 \textdegree C was evaluated at the ecologically relevant assay temperatures of between 25 and 38 \textdegree C. Different interpretations of the data are available depending on normalization. For instance, RVO2 of smaller fish, measured per fish, was remarkably stable over a wide range of assay temperatures and was not different between acclimation groups. However, when measured on a mass-specific basis, RVO2 in these same smaller fish increases more predictably as temperature increased. RVO2 of refuge fish and the closely related pupfish, C. nevadensis mionectes, measured near their respective acclimation temperatures, were essentially identical. However, RVO2 of 28 \textdegree C acclimated fish of both species, when measured at 34 \textdegree C, was greater than that of the 33 \textdegree C acclimated fish measured at 28 \textdegree C. We suggest that this observed `efficiency' may result from significant anaerobic metabolism use. Experiments investigating factorial aerobic scope ({$\mkern1mu$}MaxVO2/RVO2{$\mkern1mu$}) yielded values less than 1 in 21\textendash 36\% of the 33 \textdegree C acclimated fish. These values indicate a substantial contribution of anaerobic metabolism to energy utilization by these fish. However, muscle lactate levels are not elevated in exercising fish\textemdash a result that is consistent with paradoxical anaerobism use.},

We show that existing analyses using trophic models have generally ignored a number of important factors including (1) the high level of natural variability of forage fish, (2) the weak relationship between forage fish spawning stock size and recruitment and the role of environmental productivity regimes, (3) the size distribution of forage fish, their predators and subsequent size selective predation (4) the changes in spatial distribution of the forage fish as it influences the reproductive success of predators. We show that taking account of these factors generally tends to make the impact of fishing forage fish on their predators less than estimated from trophic models. We also explore the empirical relationship between forage fish abundance and predator abundance for a range of U.S. fisheries and show that there is little evidence for a strong connection between forage fish abundance and the rate of change in the abundance of their predators. We suggest that any evaluation of harvest policies for forage fish needs to include these issues, and that models tailored for individual species and ecosystems are needed to guide fisheries management policy.},

Here, we summarize 36 meta-analyses measuring more than 4,600 global change impacts on natural communities. We find that threshold transgressions were rarely detectable, either within or across meta-analyses. Instead, ecological responses were characterized mostly by progressively increasing magnitude and variance when pressure increased. Sensitivity analyses with modelled data revealed that minor variances in the response are sufficient to preclude the detection of thresholds from data, even if they are present. The simulations reinforced our contention that global change biology needs to abandon the general expectation that system properties allow defining thresholds as a way to manage nature under global change. Rather, highly variable responses, even under weak pressures, suggest that `safe-operating spaces' are unlikely to be quantifiable.},

Further progress could be made by integrating results from these studies into modeling frameworks to predict how or generalize when biotic interactions mediate how changing climates influence range shifts.

If small ontogenetic omnivores compete for a shared resource with their future prey, ecological persistence of ontogenetic omnivores can be hindered, although predation by large omnivores facilitates persistence. The coupling of developmental processes between different life stages might lead to a trade-off between competition early in life and predation later in life, especially for ontogenetic omnivores that lack metamorphosis. By using bioenergetic modeling, we study how such an ontogenetic trade-off affects ecological and evolutionary dynamics of ontogenetic omnivores. We find that selection toward increasing specialization of one life stage leads to evolutionary suicide of noncannibalistic ontogenetic omnivores, because it leads to a shift toward an alternative community state. Ontogenetic omnivores fail to re-invade this new state due to the maladaptiveness of the other life stage. Cannibalism stabilizes selection on the ontogenetic trade-off, prevents evolutionary suicide of ontogenetic omnivores, and promotes coexistence of omnivores with their prey. We outline how ecological and evolutionary persistence of ontogenetic omnivores depends on the type of diet change, cannibalism, and competitive hierarchy between omnivores and their prey.},

  abstract = {In basic intraguild predation (IGP) systems, predators and prey also compete for a shared resource. Theory predicts that persistence of these systems is possible when intraguild prey is superior in competition and productivity is not too high. IGP often results from ontogenetic niche shifts, in which the diet of intraguild predators changes as a result of growth in body size (life-history omnivory). As a juvenile, a life-history omnivore competes with the species that becomes its prey later in life. Competition can hence limit growth of young predators, while adult predators can suppress consumers and therewith neutralize negative effects of competition. We formulate and analyze a stage-structured model that captures both basic IGP and life-history omnivory. The model predicts increasing coexistence of predators and consumers when resource use of stage-structured predators becomes more stage specific. This coexistence depends on adult predators requiring consumer biomass for reproduction and is less likely when consumers outcompete juvenile predators, in contrast to basic IGP. Therefore, coexistence occurs when predation structures the community and competition is negligible. Consequently, equilibrium patterns over productivity resemble those of three-species food chains. Life-history omnivory thus provides a mechanism that allows intraguild predators and prey to coexist over a wide range of resource productivity.},

  abstract = {Growth in body size is accompanied by changes in foraging capacity and metabolic costs, which lead to changes in competitive ability during ontogeny. The resulting size-dependent competitive asymmetry influences population dynamics and community structure, but it is not clear whether natural selection leads to asymmetry in intraspecific competition. We address this question by using a size-structured consumer\textendash resource model, in which the strength and direction of competitive asymmetry between different consumer individuals depends on the scaling of maximum ingestion and maintenance metabolism with consumer body size. We use adaptive dynamics to study selection on the scaling exponents of these processes. Selection leads to an identical scaling of maximum ingestion and maintenance metabolism with consumer body size. Equal scaling exponents neutralize strong competitive differences within the consumer population, because all consumer individuals require the same amount of resources to cover maintenance requirements. Furthermore, the scaling exponents respond adaptively to changes in mortality such that biomass production through growth or reproduction increases in the life stage that is subject to increased mortality. Also, decreasing size at birth leads to increased investment in juvenile growth, while increasing maximum size leads to increased investment in post-maturation growth and reproduction. These results provide an explanation for observed variation in the ontogenetic scaling of metabolic rate with body size. Data of teleost fish are presented that support these predictions. However, selection towards equal scaling exponents is contradicted by empirical findings, which suggests that additional ecological complexity beyond this basic consumer\textendash resource interaction is required to understand the evolution of size-dependent asymmetry in intraspecific competition.

According to two intensely debated theories, body size affects metabolism via geometrical influences on the transport of resources and wastes. However, these theories differ crucially in whether the size dependence of metabolism is derived from material transport across external surfaces, or through internal resource-transport networks. We show that when body shape changes during growth, these models make opposing predictions. These models are tested using pelagic invertebrates, because these animals exhibit highly variable intraspecific scaling relationships for metabolic rate and body shape. Metabolic scaling slopes of diverse integument-breathing species were significantly positively correlated with degree of body flattening or elongation during ontogeny, as expected from surface area theory, but contradicting the negative correlations predicted by resource-transport network models. This finding explains strong deviations from predictions of widely adopted theory, and underpins a new explanation for mass-invariant metabolic scaling during ontogeny in animals and plants.},

Metabolic arrest occurs frequently in the animal kingdom in the face of extreme deficiencies in oxygen, heat, or water. Although many mechanisms that allow metabolism to be suppressed well below routine or standard rates have yet to be unravelled, it is clear that the overall process universally seems to involve a controlled decrease in metabolic and organelle functions coupled with a simultaneous controlled stabilization of macromolecular and organelle structures.},

Ectotherms reared under high temperatures usually show faster growth, but reach a smaller final size, a phenomenon known as the temperature-size rule (TSR). Oxygen may become a limiting resource at high temperatures, when demand for oxygen is high, especially in water as oxygen uptake is far more challenging under water than in air. Therefore, in aquatic ectotherms, the TSR might very well be mediated by temperature effects on oxygen availability and oxygen demand. To distinguish between the direct effects of temperature and oxygen mediated effects, growth rate and final size were measured in the aquatic ectotherm Asellus aquaticus (Linnaeus, 1758) reared under different temperature and oxygen conditions in a factorial design. Growth could be best described by a modified Von Bertalanffy growth function. Both temperature and oxygen affected age at maturity and growth. Growth responses to temperature were dependent on oxygen conditions (interactive effect of temperature and oxygen). Only under hypoxic conditions, when oxygen was most limiting, did we find a classic TSR. Moreover, when comparing treatments differing in temperature, but where the balance between oxygen demand and supply was similar, high temperature increased both growth rate and final size. Thus effects of oxygen may resolve the life-history puzzle of the TSR in aquatic ectotherms.},

  abstract = {The marked increase in occurrences of low oxygen events on continental shelves coupled with observed expansion of low oxygen regions of the ocean has drawn significant scientific and public attention. With this has come the need for the establishment of better definitions for widely used terms such as ``hypoxia'' and ``dead zones''. Ocean chemists and physicists use concentration units such as {$\mu$}molO2/kg for reporting since these units are independent of temperature, salinity and pressure and are required for mass balances and for numerical models of ocean transport. Much of the reporting of dead zone occurrences is in volumetric concentration units of mlO2/l or mgO2/l for historical reasons. And direct measurements of the physiological state of marine animals require reporting of the partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) in matm or kPa since this provides the thermodynamic driving force for molecular transfer through tissue. This necessarily incorporates temperature and salinity terms and thus accommodates changes driven by climate warming and the influence of the very large temperature range around the world where oxygen limiting values are reported. Here we examine the various definitions used and boundaries set and place them within a common framework. We examine the large scale ocean pO2 fields required for pairing with pCO2 data for examination of the combined impacts of ocean acidification and global warming. The term ``dead zones'', which recently has received considerable attention in both the scientific literature and the press, usually describes shallow, coastal regions of low oxygen caused either by coastal eutrophication and organic matter decomposition or by upwelling of low oxygen waters. While we make clear that bathyal low oxygen waters should not be confused with shallow-water ``dead zones'', as deep water species are well adapted, we show that those waters represent a global vast reservoir of low oxygen water which can readily be entrained in upwelling waters and contribute to coastal hypoxia around the world and may be characterized identically. We examine the potential for expansion of those water masses onto continental shelves worldwide, thereby crossing limits set for many not adapted species.},

  abstract = {Size at maturity in ectotherms commonly declines with warming. This near-universal phenomenon, formalised as the temperature\textendash size rule, has been observed in over 80\% of tested species, from bacteria to fish. The proximate cause has been attributed to the greater temperature dependence of development rate than growth rate, causing individuals to develop earlier but mature smaller in the warm. However, few studies have examined the ontogenetic progression of the temperature\textendash size response at high resolution. Using marine planktonic copepods, we experimentally determined the progression of the temperature\textendash size response over ontogeny. Temperature\textendash size responses were not generated gradually from egg to adult, contrary to the predictions of a na\"ive model in which development rate was assumed to be more temperature-dependent than growth rate, and the difference in the temperature dependence of these two rates remained constant over ontogeny. Instead, the ontogenetic progression of the temperature\textendash size response in experimental animals was highly episodic, indicating rapid changes in the extent to which growth and development rates are thermally decoupled. The strongest temperature\textendash size responses occurred temporally mid-way through ontogeny, corresponding with the point at which individuals reached between 5 and 25\% of their adult mass. Using the copepod Oithona nana, we show that the temperature-dependence of growth rate varied substantially throughout ontogeny, whereas the temperature dependence of development rate remained constant. The temperature-dependence of growth rate even exceeded that of development rate in some life stages, leading to a weakening of the temperature\textendash size response. Our analyses of arthropod temperature\textendash size responses from the literature, including crustaceans and insects, support these conclusions more broadly. Overall, our findings provide a better understanding of how the temperature\textendash size rule is produced over ontogeny. Whereas we find support for the generality of developmental rate isomorphy in arthropods (shared temperature dependence of development rate across life stages), this concept appears not to apply to growth rates.},

Yet, the degree to which these co-vary and share explanatory mechanisms has not been systematically evaluated. We present the largest quantitative comparison of these gradients to date, and find that their direction and magnitude co-vary among 12 arthropod orders (r2 = 0.72). Body size in aquatic species generally reduces with both warming and decreasing latitude, whereas terrestrial species have much reduced and even opposite gradients. These patterns support the prediction that oxygen limitation is a major controlling factor in water, but not in air. Furthermore, voltinism explains much of the variation in T-S and L-S patterns in terrestrial but not aquatic species. While body size decreases with warming and with decreasing latitude in multivoltine terrestrial arthropods, size increases on average in univoltine species, consistent with predictions from size vs. season-length trade-offs.},

We present a model, empirically grounded in data from birds and mammals, that correctly predicts how growing animals allocate food energy between synthesis of new biomass and maintenance of existing biomass. Previous energy budget models have typically had their bases in rates of either food consumption or metabolic energy expenditure. Our model provides a framework that reconciles these two approaches and highlights the fundamental principles that determine rates of food assimilation and rates of energy allocation to maintenance, biosynthesis, activity, and storage. The model predicts that growth and assimilation rates for all animals should cluster closely around two universal curves. Data for mammals and birds of diverse body sizes and taxa support these predictions.},

  abstract = {Hypoxia (low dissolved oxygen) is a mounting concern for aquatic ecosystems as its prevalence increases with rising anthropogenic nutrient inputs. Hypoxia is most commonly defined as 2.0 mg l\textendash 1 of dissolved oxygen, although this level varies widely across studies and agency regulations. Such definitions may be too conservative, as ecologically-relevant non-lethal effects (e.g. consumption and growth) of hypoxia on important aquatic species, such as fish, often occur at oxygen levels much higher than 2.0 mg l\textendash 1. In addition, many mechanisms that regulate hypoxia tolerance in fish have been proposed, including temperature, habitat, location in the water column, and body size, but there is ongoing debate over which mechanisms are most important. Using a structured meta-analysis of published studies, we showed consistent, significant negative effects on fish growth and consumption below 4.5 mg l\textendash 1. While the total amount of variation explained was generally low, below 4.5 mg l\textendash 1 of dissolved oxygen, phylogenetic relationships accounted for most of the explained variation in fish growth. Ecological factors including body size, location in the water column (pelagic, demersal, or benthopelagic), habitat (freshwater, marine, or diadromous), and temperature explained very little of the effect of hypoxia on fish growth and explained only a moderate level of variation in consumption. Our results suggest a dramatically higher threshold for sub-lethal effects of hypoxia on fish than oxygen levels generally set for regulation purposes, and provide little support for accepted ecological mechanisms thought to influence hypoxia tolerance.},

  abstract = {The question of how the scaling of metabolic rate with body mass (M) is achieved in animals is unresolved. Here, we tested the cell metabolism hypothesis and the organ size hypothesis by assessing the mass scaling of the resting metabolic rate (RMR), maximum metabolic rate (MMR), erythrocyte size, and the masses of metabolically active organs in the crucian carp (Carassius auratus). The M of the crucian carp ranged from 4.5 to 323.9 g, representing an approximately 72-fold difference. The RMR and MMR increased with M according to the allometric equations RMR = 0.212M (0.776) and MMR = 0.753M (0.785). The scaling exponents for RMR (b r) and MMR (b m) obtained in crucian carp were close to each other. Thus, the factorial aerobic scope remained almost constant with increasing M. Although erythrocyte size was negatively correlated with both mass-specific RMR and absolute RMR adjusted to M, it and all other hematological parameters showed no significant relationship with M. These data demonstrate that the cell metabolism hypothesis does not describe metabolic scaling in the crucian carp, suggesting that erythrocyte size may not represent the general size of other cell types in this fish and the metabolic activity of cells may decrease as fish grows. The mass scaling exponents of active organs was lower than 1 while that of inactive organs was greater than 1, which suggests that the mass scaling of the RMR can be partly due to variance in the proportion of active/inactive organs in crucian carp. Furthermore, our results provide additional evidence supporting the correlation between locomotor capacity and metabolic scaling.},

In a classic experiment, Brett and colleagues documented that growth rates of salmon depended strikingly on both temperature and food levels. Here we develop a simple bioenergetic model that explores how fixed temperatures and food jointly alter the thermal sensitivity of net energy gain. The model incorporates differing thermal sensitivities of energy intake and metabolism. In qualitative agreement with Brett's results, it predicts that decreased food intake reduces growth rates, lowers optimal temperatures for growth, and lowers the highest temperatures sustaining growth (upper thermal limit). Consequently, ectotherms facing reduced food intake in warm environments should restrict activity to times when low body temperatures are biophysically feasible, but\textemdash in a warming world\textemdash that will force ectotherms to shorten activity times and thus further reduce food intake. This ``metabolic meltdown'' is a consequence of declining energy intake coupled with accelerating metabolic costs at high temperatures and with warming-imposed restrictions on activity. Next, we extend the model to explore how increasing mean environmental temperatures alter the thermal sensitivity of growth: when food intake is reduced, optimal temperatures and upper thermal limits for growth are lowered. We discuss our model's key assumptions and caveats as well as its relationship to a recent model for phytoplankton. Both models illustrate that the deleterious impacts of climate warming on ectotherms will be amplified if food intake is also reduced, either because warming reduces standing food resources or because it restricts foraging time.},

We show that the bleaching responses of corals to a given level of heat exposure differed in each event and were strongly influenced by contingency and the spatial overlap and strength of interactions between events. Naive regions that escaped bleaching for a decade or longer were the most susceptible to bouts of heat exposure. Conversely, when pairs of successive bleaching episodes were close together (1\textendash 3 years apart), the thermal threshold for severe bleaching increased because the earlier event hardened regions of the Great Barrier Reef to further impacts. In the near future, the biological responses to recurrent bleaching events may become stronger as the cumulative geographic footprint expands further, potentially impairing the stock-recruitment relationships among lightly and severely bleached reefs with diverse recent histories. Understanding the emergent properties and collective dynamics of recurrent disturbances will be critical for predicting spatial refuges and cumulative ecological responses, and for managing the longer-term impacts of anthropogenic climate change on ecosystems.},

  abstract = {1. Recent theoretical insights have shown that predator species may help each other to persist by size-selective foraging on a shared prey. By feeding on a certain prey stage, a predator may induce a compensatory response in another stage of the same prey species, thereby favouring other predators; a phenomenon referred to as emergent facilitation. 2. To test whether emergent facilitation may occur in a natural system, we performed an enclosure experiment where we mimicked fish predation by selectively removing large zooplankton and subsequently following the response of the invertebrate predator Bythotrephes longimanus. 3. Positive responses to harvest were observed in the biomass of juvenile individuals of the dominant zooplankton Holopedium gibberum and in Bythotrephes densities. Hence, by removing large prey, we increased the biomass of small prey, i.e. stage-specific biomass overcompensation was present in the juvenile stage of Holopedium. This favoured Bythotrephes, which preferentially feed on small Holopedium. 4. We argue that the stage-specific overcompensation occurred as a result of increased per capita fecundity of adult Holopedium and as a result of competitive release following harvest. If shown to be common, emergent facilitation may be a major mechanism behind observed predator extinctions and patterns of predator invasions.},

  abstract = {A challenge facing ecologists trying to predict responses to climate change is the few recent analogous conditions to use for comparison. For example, negative relationships between ectotherm body size and temperature are common both across natural thermal gradients and in small-scale experiments. However, it is unknown if short-term body size responses are representative of long-term responses. Moreover, to understand population responses to warming, we must recognize that individual responses to temperature may vary over ontogeny. To enable predictions of how climate warming may affect natural populations, we therefore ask how body size and growth may shift in response to increased temperature over life history, and whether short- and long-term growth responses differ. We addressed these questions using a unique setup with multidecadal artificial heating of an enclosed coastal bay in the Baltic Sea and an adjacent reference area (both with unexploited populations), using before-after control-impact paired time-series analyses. We assembled individual growth trajectories of \textasciitilde 13,000 unique individuals of Eurasian perch and found that body growth increased substantially after warming, but the extent depended on body size: Only among small-bodied perch did growth increase with temperature. Moreover, the strength of this response gradually increased over the 24 year warming period. Our study offers a unique example of how warming can affect fish populations over multiple generations, resulting in gradual changes in body growth, varying as organisms develop. Although increased juvenile growth rates are in line with predictions of the temperature\textendash size rule, the fact that a larger body size at age was maintained over life history contrasts to that same rule. Because the artificially heated area is a contemporary system mimicking a warmer sea, our findings can aid predictions of fish responses to further warming, taking into account that growth responses may vary both over an individual's life history and over time.},

Here, we tested whether niche construction by different life-history variants of the planktivorous fish alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) can drive phenotypic divergence and resource use in the competing species bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus). Using a combination of common garden experiments and a comparative field study, we found that bluegill from landlocked alewife lakes grew relatively better when fed small than large zooplankton, had gill rakers better adapted for feeding on small-bodied prey and selected smaller zooplankton compared with bluegill from lakes with anadromous or no alewife. Observed shifts in bluegill foraging traits in lakes with landlocked alewife parallel those in alewife, suggesting interspecific competition leading to parallel phenotypic changes rather than to divergence (which is commonly predicted). Our findings suggest that species may be locally adapted to prey communities structured by different life-history variants of a competing dominant species.},

  abstract = {Over the recent decades, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) has set guidelines for best practise quality control of age estimation procedures. The applicability of these guidelines is assessed by reviewing the ageing issues of eastern Baltic cod (EBC) as a case study. Since the implementation of an age-based assessment of EBC in the beginning of the 1970s, the assessment has been hampered by the quality of the age composition data, in recent years to a degree that age-based assessment is no longer used. The reason for the age reading problems is the low visual contrast between growth zones in the otoliths which seems to be the result of complex interactions of the hydrography in the Baltic Sea with the cod's biology and behaviour. Over the last 40~years, various expert groups have struggled to document and improve the agreement of age estimation between national otolith readers, standardize methods and age estimations through repeated exchanges and reference collections as well as an internationally agreed manual. Despite these initiatives the precision of the age estimations based on traditional ageing did not improve, with significant bias persisting between and within readers. Additionally, a wide range of alternative methods for deriving the age information necessary for stock assessment and for validation of the true age have been tested. However, these methods did not produce unbiased age estimates over the entire size and age range of the EBC stock. An age-validation is urgently needed. Deviations from the ICES guidelines identified are as follows: (i) the lack of rigorous quality control, particularly the auditing of national trends in age precision over the years using a reference collection and (ii) the implementation of an age error matrix in the stock assessment.},

Personal in its reflections, the story that follows asks throughout: What constitutes an appropriate model for the communication of science-based advice that best serves society? The first ``front line,'' in 1992, involved tenuous hypotheses on the collapse and recovery of Newfoundland's Northern cod (Gadus morhua), raising troubling questions about political influence on science-based advice and on its integrity. These questions subsequently motivated a critique written with two colleagues on the communication of science to decision-makers, provoking a telling invective from a government department in defence of the status quo. The story transitions to my 2000\textendash 2012 tenure as a member and then as chair of Canada's national body advising which species should be on the legally binding national at-risk register, illustrating how politically sensitive science-based advice can be objectively, effectively, and independently communicated, unfiltered by vested interests. Since 2009, I have served as independent science advisor on the sourcing of sustainable seafood to Canada's largest food retailer, providing a meaningful, impactful opportunity to advise their decision-makers. Science-based advice, free from political and advocacy-driven vested interests, is a requisite return for tax-supported investments in science. If provision of such advice is a ``moral imperative,'' as argued more than 60 years ago by C.P. Snow, then scientists are obliged to be the best advisors that we can be.},

A twofold decline in annual survival probabilities in the 1980s was concomitant with increased inshore and offshore fishing effort, declining catch rate, and spatial shifts in gillnetting effort from areas of low (inshore) to high (offshore) catch rates. We reject hypotheses that attribute the collapse of northern cod to environmental change.

This will impact fisheries yields, but empirical evidence of the process is still limited. We used fishery-independent bottom trawl survey data from 1970 to 2017 to examine the trends of length-at-age of four commercially important demersal fish species (cod, haddock, whiting and saithe) in two study areas facing increasing sea temperatures: the West of Scotland and the North Sea. We then compared the trends of length-at-age with annual bottom sea temperatures. The mean length-at-age of adults declined over the study period, in all species and in both areas, except for cod in the West of Scotland. A common trend of decline in adult length was inversely correlated with bottom sea temperatures. Correlations with temperature at seven yearly time-lags were significant and negative in the North Sea. Correlations were only significant at lags of 1 and 2 years in the west of Scotland, where sea temperature warming was twice as slow. The mean length-at-age of juveniles concurrently increased, which has not hitherto been reported. This trend, shared by all species and both regions, correlated positively with rising temperature, suggesting that our study species have a faster growth rate due to increased temperatures. Synthesis and applications. We examined the body size of a range of commercially exploited fish species, at different age groups, from two management regions. We found that juvenile fish have been getting bigger and adults smaller in both regions. These changes were correlated with rising sea temperatures, providing empirical evidence that global warming is affecting the size of commercial fish species. The effects of these changes on productivity of fish populations and fisheries yield now require investigation. Temperature changes should, therefore, be included into forecasts used in fisheries science in order to mitigate the impact of global warming and maximise sustainable yields.},

  abstract = {Predicting the effects of climate change on ecological communities requires an understanding of how environmental factors influence both physiological processes and species interactions. Specifically, the net impact of temperature on community structure depends on the relative response of physiological energetic costs (metabolism) and energetic gains (ingestion of resources) that mediate the flow of energy throughout a food web. However, the relative temperature scaling of metabolic and ingestion rates have rarely been measured for multiple species within an ecological assemblage and it is not known how, and to what extent, these relative scaling differences vary among species. To investigate the relative influence of these processes, I measured the temperature scaling of metabolic and ingestion rates for a suite of rocky intertidal species using a multiple regression experimental design. I compared oxygen consumption rates (as a proxy for metabolic rate) and ingestion rates by estimating the temperature scaling parameter of the universal temperature dependence (UTD) model, a theoretical model derived from first principles of biochemical kinetics and allometry. The results show that consumer metabolic rates (energetic costs) tend to be more sensitive to temperature than ingestion rates (energetic gains). Thus, as temperature increases, metabolic rates tend to increase faster relative to ingestion rates, causing the overall energetic efficiencies of these rocky intertidal invertebrates to decline. Metabolic and ingestion rates largely scaled in accordance with the UTD model; however, nonlinearity was evident in several cases, particularly at higher temperatures, in which alternative models were more appropriate. There are few studies where multiple rate dependencies are measured on multiple species from the same ecological community. These results indicate that there may be general patterns across species in the temperature scaling of biological rates, with important implications for forecasting temperature effects on ecological communities.},

This is becoming increasingly relevant given climate-driven distributional shifts, because samples for estimating size-at-age can be spatially unbalanced and lead to biases when extrapolating into unsampled areas. Here, we jointly analysed data on the local abundance and size of walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) in the Bering Sea, to demonstrate a tractable first step in expanding spatially unbalanced size-at-age samples, while incorporating fine-scale spatial and temporal variation for inclusion in stock assessments. The data come from NOAA's bottom trawl survey data and were evaluated using a multivariate spatio-temporal statistical model. We found extensive variation in size-at-age at fine spatial scales, though specific patterns differed between age classes. In addition to persistent spatial patterns, we also documented year-to-year differences in the spatial patterning of size-at-age. Intra-annual variation in the population-level size-at-age (used to generate the size-at-age matrix in the stock assessment) was largely driven by localized changes in fish size, while shifts in species distribution had a smaller effect. The spatio-temporal size-at-age matrix led to marginal improvement in the stock assessment fit to the survey biomass index. Results from our case study suggest that accounting for spatially unbalanced sampling improved stock assessment consistency. Additionally, it improved our understanding on the dynamics of how local and population-level demographic processes interact. As climate change affects fish distribution and growth, integrating spatiotemporally explicit size-at-age processes with anticipated environmental conditions may improve stock-assessment forecasts used to set annual harvest limits.},

In recent years, proponents and critics of metabolic theory have debated vigorously about the scaling of metabolic rate. We show that the controversy arose, in part, because researchers examined the mean exponent separately from the variance. We estimate both quantities simultaneously using linear mixed-effects models and data from 1242 animal species. Metabolic rate scaling converges on the predicted value of 3/4 but is highly heterogeneous: 50\% of orders lie outside the range 0.68\textendash 0.82. These findings are robust to several forms of statistical uncertainty. We then test competing hypotheses about the variation. Metabolic theory is currently unable to explain differences in scaling among orders, but the patterns are not consistent with competing explanations either. We conclude that current theories are inadequate to explain the full range of metabolic scaling patterns observed in nature.},

We also compared our results to historical data from 1932. During 2006\textendash 2008, lake trout diet consisted mainly of alewives (Alosa pseudoharengus) and rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax), whereas burbot utilized a much wider prey base including round goby (Neogobius melanostomus), rainbow smelt, alewives, and sculpins. Using the Schoener's diet overlap index, we found a higher potential for interspecific competition in 1932 than in 2006\textendash 2008, though diet overlap was not significant in either time period. No evidence of cannibalism by lake trout or lake trout predation on burbot was found in either time period. In 2006\textendash 2008, however, lake trout composed 5.4\% (by weight) of burbot diet. To determine whether this predation could be having an impact on lake trout rehabilitation efforts in northern Lake Michigan, we developed a bioenergetic-based consumption estimate for burbot on Boulder Reef (a representative reef within the Northern Refuge) and found that burbot alone can consume a considerable proportion of the yearling lake trout stocked annually, depending on burbot density. Overall, we conclude that predation, rather than competition, is the more important ecological interaction between burbot and lake trout, and burbot predation may be contributing to the failed lake trout rehabilitation efforts in Lake Michigan.},

In particular, changes in temperature and increased variability can cause shifts in spatial distribution, leading to changes in local physiological rates and recruitment success. Yet, management of fish stocks rarely accounts for variable spatial dynamics or changes in movement rates when estimating management quantities such as stock abundance or maximum sustainable yield. To address this concern, a management strategy evaluation (MSE) was developed to evaluate the robustness of the international management system for Pacific hake, an economically important migratory stock, by incorporating spatio-temporal population dynamics. Alternative hypotheses about climate-induced changes in age-specific movement rates, in combination with three different harvest control rules (HCR), were evaluated using a set of simulations that coupled single-area estimation models with alternative operating models representing spatial stock complexity. Movement rates intensified by climate change caused a median decline in catches, increased annual catch variability, and lower average spawning biomass. Impacts varied by area and HCR, underscoring the importance of spatial management. Incorporating spatial dynamics and climate change effects into management procedures for fish stocks with spatial complexity is warranted to mitigate risk and uncertainty for exploited marine populations.},

  abstract = {Managing fisheries presents trade-offs between objectives, for example yields, profits, minimizing ecosystem impact, that have to be weighed against one another. These trade-offs are compounded by interacting species and fisheries at the ecosystem level. Weighing objectives becomes increasingly challenging when managers have to consider opposing objectives from different stakeholders. An alternative to weighing incomparable and conflicting objectives is to focus on win\textendash wins until Pareto efficiency is achieved: a state from which it is impossible to improve with respect to any objective without regressing at least one other. We investigate the ecosystem-level efficiency of fisheries in five large marine ecosystems (LMEs) with respect to yield and an aggregate measure of ecosystem impact using a novel calibration of size-based ecosystem models. We estimate that fishing patterns in three LMEs (North Sea, Barents Sea and Benguela Current) are nearly efficient with respect to long-term yield and ecosystem impact and that efficiency has improved over the last 30 years. In two LMEs (Baltic Sea and North East US Continental Shelf), fishing is inefficient and win\textendash wins remain available. We additionally examine the efficiency of North Sea and Baltic Sea fisheries with respect to economic rent and ecosystem impact, finding both to be inefficient but steadily improving. Our results suggest the following: (i) a broad and encouraging trend towards ecosystem-level efficiency of fisheries; (ii) that ecosystem-scale win\textendash wins, especially with respect to conservation and profits, may still be common; and (iii) single-species assessment approaches may overestimate the availability of win\textendash wins by failing to account for trade-offs across interacting species.},

  abstract = {Identifying factors determining the performance of individuals is an essential part of resolving what drives population dynamics. For species undergoing ontogenetic shifts in resource and habitat use, this entails assessing individual performance in all habitats used. Whereas survival and growth of anadromous Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., in its juvenile, river habitat are known to depend on size-dependent foraging and food availability, individual performance of salmon in the growth habitat out at sea is commonly explained only by abiotic factors. Still, individuals undergo this habitat shift to grow large, suggesting performance should be food-dependent also in the growth habitat. Because fish communities are highly size-structured, the link between predators and their prey may depend on their respective body sizes. Here, we study whether the performance of Baltic Sea salmon in its growth habitat is food- and sizedependent, by combining extensive diet and body size data of Baltic salmon with spatially resolved monitoring data on abundance and size distribution of their main prey, herring, Clupea harengus L., and sprat, Sprattus sprattus L. We found that both the species and size composition of prey in the diet varied with salmon body size. By accounting for this size-dependent predation and the spatially varying size distribution of prey species, we could explain the variation in salmon diet composition among salmon individuals in different Baltic Sea basins and of different length. The proportion of sprat in diet of salmon was better explained by size-specific prey availability (SSP) than total prey biomass, especially for small salmon. Further, salmon body condition increased with SSP, whereas total prey biomass could not explain variation in the condition of salmon. These findings demonstrate that food- and size-dependent processes indeed can influence the performance of anadromous fish also in large marine systems. Thus, we argue that consideration of these processes, stretching across habitats, is important for understanding performance and dynamics of predatory fish in open aquatic systems, as well as for successful management of species such as Atlantic salmon.},

  abstract = {Existing estimates of fish and consumer biomass in the world's oceans are disparate. This creates uncertainty about the roles of fish and other consumers in biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem processes, the extent of human and environmental impacts and fishery potential. We develop and use a size-based macroecological model to assess the effects of parameter uncertainty on predicted consumer biomass, production and distribution. Resulting uncertainty is large (e.g. median global biomass 4.9 billion tonnes for consumers weighing 1 g to 1000 kg; 50\% uncertainty intervals of 2 to 10.4 billion tonnes; 90\% uncertainty intervals of 0.3 to 26.1 billion tonnes) and driven primarily by uncertainty in trophic transfer efficiency and its relationship with predator-prey body mass ratios. Even the upper uncertainty intervals for global predictions of consumer biomass demonstrate the remarkable scarcity of marine consumers, with less than one part in 30 million by volume of the global oceans comprising tissue of macroscopic animals. Thus the apparently high densities of marine life seen in surface and coastal waters and frequently visited abundance hotspots will likely give many in society a false impression of the abundance of marine animals. Unexploited baseline biomass predictions from the simple macroecological model were used to calibrate a more complex size- and trait-based model to estimate fisheries yield and impacts. Yields are highly dependent on baseline biomass and fisheries selectivity. Predicted global sustainable fisheries yield increases {$\approx$}4 fold when smaller individuals ({$<$} 20 cm from species of maximum mass {$<$} 1kg) are targeted in all oceans, but the predicted yields would rarely be accessible in practice and this fishing strategy leads to the collapse of larger species if fishing mortality rates on different size classes cannot be decoupled. Our analyses show that models with minimal parameter demands that are based on a few established ecological principles can support equitable analysis and comparison of diverse ecosystems. The analyses provide insights into the effects of parameter uncertainty on global biomass and production estimates, which have yet to be achieved with complex models, and will therefore help to highlight priorities for future research and data collection. However, the focus on simple model structures and global processes means that non-phytoplankton primary production and several groups, structures and processes of ecological and conservation interest are not represented. Consequently, our simple models become increasingly less useful than more complex alternatives when addressing questions about food web structure and function, biodiversity, resilience and human impacts at smaller scales and for areas closer to coasts.},

Using fish as our study taxa, we curated 25 studies with measurements of standard metabolic rate, temperature, and mass, with 55 independent trials and across 16 fish species and confronted this data with flexible random effects models. To quantify the body mass \textendash metabolic rate relationship, we perform model selection using the Schwarz Information Criteria ( SIC), an established evidence function. Further, we formulate and justify the use of SIC intervals to delineate the values of the metabolic scaling relationship that should be retained for further consideration. We found strong evidence for a metabolic scaling coefficient of 0.89 with a SIC interval spanning 0.82 to 0.99, implying that mechanistically derived coefficients of 0.67, 0.75, and 1, are not supported by the data. Model selection supports the use of a random intercepts and random slopes by species, consistent with the idea that other factors, such as taxonomy or ecological or lifestyle characteristics, may be critical for discerning the underlying process giving rise to the data. The evidentialist framework applied here, allows for further refinement given additional data and more complex models.},

  abstract = {Climate change has complex structural impacts on coastal ecosystems. Global warming is linked to a widespread decline in body size, whereas increased flood frequency can amplify nutrient enrichment through enhanced run-off. Altered population body-size structure represents a disruption in top-down control, whereas eutrophication embodies a change in bottom-up forcing. These processes are typically studied in isolation and little is known about their potential interactive effects. Here, we present the results of an in situ experiment examining the combined effects of top-down and bottom-up forces on the structure of a coastal marine community. Reduced average body mass of the top predator (the shore crab, Carcinus maenas) and nutrient enrichment combined additively to alter mean community body mass. Nutrient enrichment increased species richness and overall density of organisms. Reduced top-predator body mass increased community biomass. Additionally, we found evidence for an allometrically induced trophic cascade. Here, the reduction in top-predator body mass enabled greater biomass of intermediate fish predators within the mesocosms. This, in turn, suppressed key micrograzers, which led to an overall increase in microalgal biomass. This response highlights the possibility for climate-induced trophic cascades, driven by altered size structure of populations, rather than species extinction.},

  abstract = {Flatfishes drastically change their habitat, body form, and feeding during metamorphosis; thus, the early juvenile and larval stages are viewed as being critical for early survival. However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have tested the growth-mortality hypothesis for both larval and juvenile stages of flatfishes. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between growth rate and environmental factors and tested the hypothesis for both larval and juvenile stages of marbled sole Pseudopleuronectes yokohamae in Hakodate Bay, Japan from 2001 to 2003. For both larval and juvenile stages, otolith growth correlated with water temperature. Eye-migrating larvae were defined as survivors of planktonic life (SV pelagic). Large juveniles captured in late June and July were defined as survivors of shrimp predation (SVjuvenile). To test the growth-mortality hypothesis, otolith growth was compared between the SV and the original population. During the pelagic larval stage, growth-selective survival was not detected in any of the 3 yr. During the early juvenile stage, fast-growing individuals survived selectively in 2002 but not in 2003. In 2002, population growth of juveniles was slow because water temperatures were low. Thus, juveniles in 2002 required time to exceed the size spectrum that is vulnerable to shrimp predation; consequently, the individuals that grew more rapidly were able to survive selectively. Our results show the importance of the early juvenile stage for the survival of flatfishes.},

  abstract = {There are many methods available for estimating the current abundance of fish species. Design-based estimators, which assume random sampling within the sampling domain, have conventionally been used to provide relative indices of abundance. More recently, the use of spatiotemporal models has increased because of their ability to explicitly account for spatial heterogeneity and higher precision relative to design-based estimators. In theory, the inclusion of covariates (e.g., depth) should also improve precision by explaining a portion of the variability in fish abundance. We used a simulation experiment to evaluate the bias and precision of results from spatiotemporal index-standardization models when the true process was and was not governed by depth. The simulation was conditioned on fits to data for darkblotched rockfish (Sebastes crameri) because of the known preference of older individuals for deeper water, coupled with their limited migration after recruiting to the fishery. Trends in the simulated indices of abundance were estimated without bias, although individual parameters were not necessarily unbiased. Incorrectly including depth when it did not govern the true process was less problematic than not including it when it should have been included. Akaike Information Criterion correctly identified overfitting when the true dynamics were not governed by depth. Results illustrate how spatiotemporal models can include covariates, but additional testing is needed with respect to the utility of including dynamic covariates that vary in space and time or covariates that do not covary with latitude or longitude.},

Model selection can be used to identify a single best model, thus lending support to one particular hypothesis, or it can be used to make inferences based on weighted support from a complete set of competing models. Model selection is widely accepted and well developed in certain fields, most notably in molecular systematics and mark-recapture analysis. However, it is now gaining support in several other areas, from molecular evolution to landscape ecology. Here, we outline the steps of model selection and highlight several ways that it is now being implemented. By adopting this approach, researchers in ecology and evolution will find a valuable alternative to traditional null hypothesis testing, especially when more than one hypothesis is plausible.},

  abstract = {In the face of rapid global change and an uncertain fate for biodiversity, it is vital to quantify trends in wild populations. These trends are typically estimated from abundance time series for suites of species across large geographic and temporal scales. Such data implicitly contain phylogenetic, spatial, and temporal structure which, if not properly accounted for, may obscure the true magnitude and direction of biodiversity change. Here, using a novel statistical framework to simultaneously account for all three of these structures, we show that the majority of current abundance trends estimates among 10 high-profile datasets, representing millions of abundance observations, are likely unreliable or incorrect. Our new approach suggests that previous models are too simplistic, incorrectly estimating global abundance trends and often dramatically underestimating uncertainty, an aspect that is critical when translating global assessments into policy outcomes. Further, our approach also results in substantial improvements in abundance forecasting accuracy. Whilst our results do not improve the outlook for biodiversity, our framework does allow us to make more robust estimates of global wildlife abundance trends, which is critical for developing policy to protect our biosphere.},

  abstract = {The reaction norm between growth rate, age and size at maturity in ectotherms is widely debated in ecological literature. It has been proposed that the effect depends on whether growth is affected by food quality or temperature (called the Berrigan-Charnov puzzle). The present experiment tested this for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). We enhanced growth rates by increasing temperature and ratio of lipids to proteins in the food for groups of Atlantic salmon. Both treatments gave higher percentages of early mature and therefore smaller adults in contrast to the proposed Berrigan-Charnov puzzle. There was a difference between sexes in that males could attain maturity 1 year younger than females when reared under similar environmental conditions. Males that matured during the first year in sea water were smaller than similar aged immature males. The probability of that Atlantic salmon attained maturity for the first time during their second year in sea increased with growth rate during the preceding winter and if fed a high-lipid diet. Increased summer temperature exhibited no additional effect. Similar aged fish reared at elevated temperature and fed high-lipid diet attained maturity at a larger body mass and exhibited higher mass-length-ratios than those reared at natural temperature and fed a low-lipid diet, indicating that structural growth has priority over lipid deposits. Increased growth rate before the onset of maturation, whether this is owing to enhanced lipid content in food or increased water temperature, decreased age and therefore size at maturity. Enhanced lipid relative to protein content in food, but not temperature, had an additive positive effect on early maturation probability, likely due to increased amounts of reserve energy. These results may be general for ectotherm organisms.},

We present results from an energy-allocation life history model that shed light on the underlying logic of skipped spawning, based on the Northeast Arctic stock of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). The model predicts that skipped spawning is a regular phenomenon, with up to 30\% of the sexually mature biomass skipping spawning. Spawning should be skipped if the expected future gain in reproductive output, discounted by survival, more than balances the expected reproductive success the current year. Skipped spawning was most common (i) among potential  second-time spawners and (ii) early in life, (iii) when fishing mortality at the spawning grounds was high, (iv) when fishing mortality at the feeding grounds was low, (v) when natural mortality was low, and (vi) when the energetic and mortality costs associated with migration and spawning were high. Cod skipped spawning more often when food availability was both increased (opportunities for better growth) and decreased (too little energy for gonad development), and this pattern interacted with mortality rate. We conclude that skipped spawning may be more widespread than  appreciated and highlight potential consequences for the understanding of stockrecruitment relationships.},

  abstract = {The stability of ecological communities depends strongly on quantitative characteristics of population interactions (type-II vs. type-III functional responses) and the distribution of body masses across species. Until now, these two aspects have almost exclusively been treated separately leaving a substantial gap in our general understanding of food webs. We analysed a large data set of arthropod feeding rates and found that all functional-response parameters depend on the body masses of predator and prey. Thus, we propose generalised functional responses which predict gradual shifts from type-II predation of small predators on equally sized prey to type-III functional-responses of large predators on small prey. Models including these generalised functional responses predict population dynamics and persistence only depending on predator and prey body masses, and we show that these predictions are strongly supported by empirical data on forest soil food webs. These results help unravelling systematic relationships between quantitative population interactions and large-scale community patterns.},

  abstract = {Renewed interest in the estimation of spatial and temporal variation in fish traits, such as body size, is a result of computing advances and the development of spatially-explicit management frameworks. However, many attempts to quantify spatial structure or the distribution of traits utilize a priori approaches, which involve pre-designated geographic regions and thus cannot detect unanticipated spatial patterns. We developed a new, model-based method that uses the first derivative of the spatial smoothing term of a generalized additive model to identify spatial zones of variation in fish length-at-age. We use simulation testing to evaluate the method across a variety of synthetic, stratified age and length datasets, and then apply it to survey data for Northeast Pacific sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria). Simulation testing illustrates the robustness of the method across a variety of scenarios related to spatially or temporally stratified length-at-age data, including strict boundaries, overlapping zones and changes at the extreme of the range. Results indicate that length-at-age for Northeast Pacific sablefish increases with latitude, which is consistent with previous work from the western United States. Model-detected spatial breakpoints corresponded to major oceanographic features, including the northern end of the Southern California Bight and the bifurcation of the North Pacific Current. This method has the potential to improve detection of large-scale patterns in fish growth, and aid in the development of spatiotemporally structured population dynamics models to inform ecosystem-based fisheries management.},

They can intricately affect survival rates, which are particularly relevant for species under exploitation. Using individual spatiotemporal information in Northwestern Mediterranean, we document for the first time the existence of a trade-off between condition and growth in regulating survival dynamics in two important fish species for the Mediterranean fisheries that are characterized by contrasting life histories. For the European hake (Merluccius merluccius), a benthopelagic species, juveniles' body condition was detected to be positively linked to survival and negatively associated with the growth of this age group. For the red mullet (Mullus barbatus), the same pattern was observed for young adults. We also show that the observed patterns on a regional level have a clear spatial dependence as we found that observed body condition over a local scale had a broad effect on the population dynamics of the whole region, with the Ebro delta area emerging as the demographic engine of the two species. We discuss our results in the context of fisheries management and underline the importance of improving current stock assessment models and spatially based fishery management towards incorporating body condition and growth due to their influence on important parameters such as survival.},

This was tested using partial least square regressions with status metrics for gray seal, cod, herring, sprat and the benthic predatory isopod Saduria as response variables, and abundance and food value of their prey, abundance of competitors and predators as predictors. We find evidence that the physiological status of cod, herring and sprat is influenced by competition, predation, and prey availability; herring and sprat status also by prey size.

To better prepare for and respond to these challenges, the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service has called for increasing the production, delivery, and use of climate and environmental information to fulfil its living marine resource stewardship mandates. Addressing these challenges and more formally including climate-informed decision-making in the fisheries management process requires strengthening and adapting the current fisheries management framework. We focus on two impacts of a changing climate, shifting species distributions and changing productivity, which can have significant implications for effective fisheries management. We identify six key steps of a climate-informed science-to-management system: detecting changes, understanding mechanisms of changes, evaluating risks and priorities, conducting assessments, communicating advice, and making management decisions. For each step, we identify challenges and provide recommendations to address those challenges and increase the capacity to develop and apply climate-related science to support sustainable fisheries management in a changing world.},

We quantified temporal changes in the distribution of 0-group cod (Gadus morhua) and grey gurnard (Eutriglia gurnardus), a primary predator of 0-group cod, with the help of regression kriging and assessed the temporal dynamics of the related spatial predator\textendash prey overlap of these two species at different spatial scales. We analysed the robustness of relationships among abiotic habitat properties (temperature, salinity and depth) and abundance. Small cod was mainly found in low salinity areas of the Skagerrak but larger year classes were able to expand their distribution area towards the central and northern North Sea. In contrast, grey gurnard was mainly found in waters with salinities above 33 and temperatures above 14\textdegree C. This species has expanded its high density areas in the central North Sea northward over the last two decades. Recruitment success of cod was negatively correlated to a Moran's I cross-correlation index, a proxy for the degree of spatial overlap between both species. Strong cod year classes overlapped less with grey gurnard at the large and medium spatial scale. In general, the relationships between abiotic habitat properties and abundance showed an increased inter-annual variability, which was likely caused by underlying factors not taken into account in the distribution models. Thus assemblage modeling approaches combining the strength of different model types should be considered in the future to predict potential distribution patterns under climate change scenarios.},

For marine species, such data hardly can be obtained from observation but need to be modelled from point data. A promising approach is regression kriging that addresses biological response to environmental conditions and spatial autocorrelation in data. Here it was applied to abundance data of North Sea prey fish sprat, Norway pout and herring. Results show seasonal and inter-annual variability of distribution limits, core areas and high abundance areas of all three species. Core areas of sprat and Norway pout are complementary bordering roughly along the 50~m isobaths. Small overlap of the two core areas were found only off the northern English coast. The comparison of North Sea-wide sums with assessment estimates show that the regression kriging approach can reproduce inter-annual dynamics. The outcomes allow assessing the magnitude of the catchability of the employed fishing gear and give evidence of seasonal variation of catchability. Capabilities and restrictions of the applied model and data are discussed in the light of niche theory. Results are of potential use in the assessment of the effects of changed utilization of marine areas in the marine spatial planning framework.},

However, evidence has been found in several species to both support and oppose this hypothesis. To determine if SDA is positively linked to the production performance of a novel finfish aquaculture species, SDA was measured in juvenile hapuku Polyprion oxygeneios at two temperatures with two different ration sizes (i.e. 15\textdegree C with a 0.75\% and 1.5\% body weight ration and 21\textdegree C with a 1.5\% and 3\% body weight ration) and compared to the specific growth rate (SGR) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) of hapuku raised for 6weeks at the same levels of temperature and ration size. A marked effect of temperature on SDA was found and the magnitude of SDA was significantly higher for the shared ration size (1.5\% body weight) at 21\textdegree C than 15\textdegree C. However, only the peak of the SDA response (SDApeak) and the total energy used during the response (SDA energy) increased with ration size at both temperatures. Higher SDA parameters were linked with higher growth performance in juvenile hapuku under certain scenarios but, because SGR was significantly lower at 21\textdegree C than 15\textdegree C for the shared ration size of 1.5\% body weight, the SDA\textendash growth relationship was not consistent and was likely under the interactive influence of temperature and ration size. Indeed, in some scenarios higher SDA provided greater growth at 21\textdegree C but the higher maintenance cost (i.e. MO2standard) of fish at this upper temperature may have constrained fish growth when only a 1.5\% body weight ration was delivered. FCR was not positively related to SDA so this study does not support the hypothesis that SDA predicts the production performance of juvenile hapuku across a range of temperatures and ration sizes.},

On the basis that the energetic costs of rapid growth are substantial and need to be accommodated physiologically, it was hypothesised that maximal growth and optimal feed conversion (feed conversion ratio, FCR) would be maximised at temperatures where aerobic metabolic scope (AMS) was also maximised. It was further hypothesised that hapuku would behaviourally self-select temperatures that lead to the greatest level of AMS, growth and FCR performance. Acclimating hapuku juveniles to 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24\textdegree C for 4weeks resulted in a peak in specific growth rate (SGR) at 18 and 21\textdegree C with slower growth at lower and higher temperatures. AMS was also maximal between 18 and 21\textdegree C and was therefore tightly linked with SGR. The behavioural thermal preference (Tpref) range of hapuku also fell within the optimum range for growth. FCR, however, was inversely related to temperature with the most and least efficient rates of conversion occurring at 12\textdegree C and 24\textdegree C respectively. Though AMS and Tpref had no utility in predicting the optimal range for FCR, standard metabolic rate (SMR) showed a positive linear relationship to FCR. The conclusions of the study are threefold: 1) Hapuku select temperatures that optimise both AMS and growth. 2) AMS and Tpref appear tightly linked with SGR and could possibly be used to predict the optimum temperature for growth in novel species. 3) AMS and Tpref have no utility in predicting the optimum temperature for FCR.},

However, the oxygen challenge hypothesis often ignores the effect of known phenotypic plastic responses. These can occur on either a within- or multigenerational scale, where multiple reactions act in concert to increase oxygen supply in response to increased temperature in a wide range of traits (molecular, egg content, behavioural, cell structure, morphological). Here, we combine a novel modelling approach with empirical measurements that enable quantification of how both the oxygen supply (maximum oxygen diffusion rate) and demand (metabolic rate) are affected by temperature while allowing for phenotypic plasticity. We exposed the aquatic ectotherm Daphnia magna to a range of temperatures (17\textendash 28\textdegree C) over several asexual generations and confirm that phenotypic plasticity contributes to an increased ability to obtain oxygen on the whole-organism level at high temperatures. This response is strongest within the highest temperature range (22\textendash 28\textdegree C), where the change in oxygen challenge is expected to be most pronounced. However, the observed thermal plasticity in oxygen supply failed to compensate for the increased demand. Thus, we provide empirical evidence that the oxygen challenge in aquatic ectotherms increases with increasing temperature, even in the presence of phenotypic plasticity in oxygen supply.

While well studied at the species level, less is known about factors affecting the preferred temperature of individuals; especially lacking is information on how physiological traits are linked to thermal preference and whether such relationships are affected by factors such feeding history and growth trajectory. This study examined these issues in the common minnow Phoxinus phoxinus, to determine the extent to which feeding history, standard metabolic rate (SMR) and aerobic scope (AS), interact to affect temperature preference. Individuals were either: 1) food deprived (FD) for 21 days, then fed ad libitum for the next 74 days; or 2) fed ad libitum throughout the entire period. All animals were then allowed to select preferred temperatures using a shuttle-box, and then measured for SMR and AS at 10 degrees C, estimated by rates of oxygen uptake. Activity within the shuttle-box under a constant temperature regime was also measured. In both FD and control fish, SMR was negatively correlated with preferred temperature. The SMR of the FD fish was increased compared with the controls, probably due to the effects of compensatory growth, and so these growth-compensated fish preferred temperatures that were on average 2.85 degrees C cooler than controls fed a maintenance ration throughout the study. Fish experiencing compensatory growth also displayed a large reduction in activity. In growth-compensated fish and controls, activity measured at 10 degrees C was positively correlated with preferred temperature. Individual fish prefer temperatures that vary predictably with SMR and activity level, which are both plastic in response to feeding history and growth trajectories. Cooler temperatures probably allow individuals to reduce maintenance costs and divert more energy towards growth. A reduction in SMR at cooler temperatures, coupled with a decrease in spontaneous activity, could also allow individuals to increase surplus AS for coping with environmental stressors. In warming climates, however, aquatic ectotherms could experience frequent fluctuations in food supply with long-lasting effects on metabolic rate due to compensatory growth, while simultaneously having limited access to preferred cooler habitats.},

We test these predictions by examining the effects of lifestyle, swimming mode and temperature on intraspecific scaling of resting metabolic rate among 89 species of teleost fish. As predicted, b decreased as L increased with temperature, and with shifts in lifestyle from bathyal and benthic to benthopelagic to pelagic. This effect of lifestyle on b may be related to varying amounts of energetically expensive tissues associated with different capacities for swimming during predator-prey interactions.},

  abstract = {Temperature provides a powerful theme for exploring environmental adaptation at all levels of biological organization, from molecular kinetics to organismal fitness to global biogeography. First, the thermodynamic properties that underlie biochemical kinetics and protein stability determine the overall thermal sensitivity of rate processes. Consequently, a single quantitative framework can assess variation in thermal sensitivity of ectotherms in terms of single amino acid substitutions, quantitative genetics, and interspecific differences. Thermodynamic considerations predict that higher optimal temperatures will result in greater maximal fitness at the optimum, a pattern seen both in interspecific comparisons and in within-population genotypic variation. Second, the temperature-size rule (increased developmental temperature causes decreased adult body size) is a common pattern of phenotypic plasticity in ectotherms. Mechanistic models can correctly predict the rule in some taxa, but lab and field studies show that rapid evolution can weaken or even break the rule. Third, phenotypic and evolutionary models for thermal sensitivity can be combined to explore potential fitness consequences of climate warming for terrestrial ectotherms. Recent analyses suggest that climate change will have greater negative fitness consequences for tropical than for temperate ectotherms, because many tropical species have relatively narrow thermal breadths and smaller thermal safety margins.},

  abstract = {Trait-based ecology merges evolutionary with classical population and community ecology and is a rapidly developing branch of ecology. It describes ecosystems as consisting of individuals rather than species, and characterizes individuals by few key traits that are interrelated through trade-offs. The fundamental rationale is that the spatio-temporal distribution of organisms and their functional role in ecosystems depend on their traits rather than on their taxonomical affiliation. The approach respects that interactions are between individuals, not between species or populations, and in trait-based models ecosystem structure emerges as a result of interactions between individuals and with the environments, rather than being prescribed. It offers an alternative to classical species-centric approaches and has the potential to describe complex ecosystems in simple ways and to assess the effects of environmental change on ecosystem structure and function. Here, we describe the components of the trait-based approach and apply it to describe and model marine ecosystems. Our description is illustrated with multiple examples of life in the ocean from unicellular plankton to fish.},

We assessed how 39 fisheries resources\textemdash ranging from data-poor to data-rich stocks\textemdash in the North East Atlantic are most likely affected under the intermediate climate emission scenario RCP4.5 towards 2050. This region is one of the most productive waters in the world but subjected to pronounced climate change, especially in the northernmost part. In this climate impact assessment, we applied a hybrid solution combining expert opinions (scorings)\textemdash supported by an extensive literature review\textemdash with mechanistic approaches, considering stocks in three different large marine ecosystems, the North, Norwegian and Barents Seas. This approach enabled calculation of the directional effect as a function of climate exposure and sensitivity attributes (life-history schedules), focusing on local stocks (conspecifics) across latitudes rather than the species in general. The resulting synopsis (50\textendash 82\textdegree N) contributes substantially to global assessments of major fisheries (FAO, The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture, 2020), complementing related studies off northeast United States (35\textendash 45\textdegree N) (Hare et al., PLoS One, 2016, 11, e0146756) and Portugal (37\textendash 42\textdegree N) (Bueno-Pardo et al., Scientific Reports, 2021, 11, 2958). Contrary to prevailing fisheries forecasts elsewhere, we found that most assessed stocks respond positively. However, the underlying, extensive environmental clines implied that North East Atlantic stocks will develop entirely different depending upon the encountered stressors: cold-temperate stocks at the southern and Arctic stocks at the northern fringes appeared severely negatively impacted, whereas warm-temperate stocks expanding from south were found to do well along with cold-temperate stocks currently inhabiting below-optimal temperatures in the northern subregion.},

This nine parameter model is based on detailed observations on the growth and reproduction at varying food densities, and has the state variables size and storage. The size-dependence of some variables works out to be different for animals of the same species as opposed to animals of different species. The reproductive rate, for instance, tends to increase with size for animals of the same species, but to decrease with size for animals of different species. This is because the parameter values are constants within a species, but vary in a size dependent manner for animals of different species. Although growth at constant food density is assumed to be of the von Bertalanffy type, and routine metabolism to be proportional to size, respiration turns out to be about proportional to size to the power 3/4, both within and between species. The value of about 3/4 has frequently been found, but it has always been thought to be incompatible with von Bertalanffy growth.},

Unlike other classes of vertebrates, however, small freshwater fishes appear to have an equal or greater risk of extinction than large fishes. We explored whether particular traits explain the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List conservation status of small-bodied freshwater fishes from 4 temperate river basins: Murray-Darling, Australia; Danube, Europe; Mississippi-Missouri, North America; and the Rio Grande, North America. Twenty-three ecological and life-history traits were collated for all 171 freshwater fishes of {$\leq$}120 mm total length. We used generalized linear mixed-effects models to assess which combination of the 23 traits best explained whether a species was threatened or not threatened. We used the best models to predict the probability of 29 unclassified species being listed as threatened. With and without controlling for phylogeny at the family level, small body size-among small-bodied species-was the most influential trait correlated with threatened species listings. The k-folds cross-validation demonstrated that body size and a random effect structure that included family predicted the threat status with an accuracy of 78\% (SE 0.5). We identified 10 species likely to be threatened that are not listed as such on the IUCN Red List. Small body size is not a trait that provides universal resistance to extinction, particularly for vertebrates inhabiting environments affected by extreme habitat loss and fragmentation. We hypothesize that this is because small-bodied species have smaller home ranges, lower dispersal capabilities, and heightened ecological specialization relative to larger vertebrates. Trait data and further model development are needed to predict the IUCN conservation status of the over 11,000 unclassified freshwater fishes, especially those under threat from proposed dam construction in the world's most biodiverse river basins.},

Among the fastest moving species are boreal generalist fish which are expected to affect arctic marine food web structure and ecosystem functioning substantially. Here, we address structural changes at the food web level induced by poleward shifts via topological network analysis of highly resolved boreal and arctic food webs of the Barents Sea. We detected considerable differences in structural properties and link configuration between the boreal and the arctic food webs, the latter being more modular and less connected. We found that a main characteristic of the boreal fish moving poleward into the arctic region of the Barents Sea is high generalism, a property that increases connectance and reduces modularity in the arctic marine food web. Our results reveal that habitats form natural boundaries for food web modules, and that generalists play an important functional role in coupling pelagic and benthic modules. We posit that these habitat couplers have the potential to promote the transfer of energy and matter between habitats, but also the spread of pertubations, thereby changing arctic marine food web structure considerably with implications for ecosystem dynamics and functioning.},

To explain these allometries, we assume that the parameters of within-species functions describing the size dependence of production and mortality rates differ between species of the same taxon and that natural selection has optimized body size through optimal allocation of resources to growth and reproduction independently in each species. In a simple simulation model, we obtain good interspecific allometries for respiration, assimilation, production rates, age at maturity, and life expectancy. Some correlations, for example, those between age at maturity and life expectancy, remain significant after the effect of body size is removed. The slopes of the allometries depend not only on the average values of the parameters but also on their coefficients of variation. We show analytically how these slopes are determined for a simplifed model and how body size distributions are determined. In our model, interspecific allometries emerge as a result of body size optimization and the distributions of intraspecific production and mortality parameters.},

Here the analysis is extended to animals with indeterminate growth, such as fish or reptiles. In a seasonal environment it is optimal to grow after maturation, and increasingly more resources should be devoted to reproduction year after year. This leads to growth curves that closely resemble Bertalanffy's curves characterized by growth constant k and asymptotic length l({$\infty$}). Sets of parameters describing mortality and productivity were generated with a random number generator. Then the schedule of growth was calculated for each 'species' obtained, under the assumption of optimal allocation of resources. Interspecific comparisons in a set of such species resemble the empirical patterns discovered by Beverton and Holt and discussed extensively by Charnov: mortality rate and growth constant k are positively related, length at maturity and asymptotic length l({$\infty$}) are positively correlated, and k and l({$\infty$}) are negatively correlated. Data for fish and reptiles match these predictions.},

When this ``Rosa Lee phenomenon'' is ignored, bias may occur in catch and stock projections. In a length-and-age-based model we quantified the effects through simulations of a simplified fishery on a stock that resembles Western Baltic cod. We compared outcomes of runs with and without taking account of the Rosa Lee phenomenon in scenarios of changes in fishing mortality. We found that, when only fishing rate was changed, the biases in predictions of spawning-stock biomass (SSB), yield and catches of undersized fish were relatively small (\&lt;10\% in absolute values). When the selectivity parameters of the gear were increased, the bias in the prediction of the catches of undersized fish was very substantial (+120 to 160\%). When the selectivity parameters were decreased, the biases in the predictions of SSB, yield and catches of undersized fish, were substantial (25\textendash 50\% in absolute values). With slower mean growth the biases became more pronounced. We conclude that in short-term forecasts, medium-term projections, and MSE simulations featuring selectivity changes, the Rosa Lee phenomenon should be accounted for, ideally by using length-based models.},

A consideration of oxygen as a resource suggests that net oxygen gain per unit of energy expenditure will be the most useful currency for ecological models of breathing. In the process of oxygen uptake, fish always expend energy on perfusion, usually on ventilation and often on locomotion. These costs, and the risk of predation, will vary with oxygen availability and the type of behavioral response shown. The principal categories of behavioral response to reduced external availability of dissolved oxygen are (1) changes in activity, (2) increased use of air breathing, (3) increased use of aquatic surface respiration, and (4) vertical or horizontal habitat changes. Fish should choose whichever combination of responses minimizes the costs of meeting their oxygen demands. A small number of studies provides qualitative support for this prediction.},

  abstract = {Species- and size-selective overexploitation often have ecosystem-wide impacts that are evident in community size spectra. To both derive potential ecosystem targets for community rebuilding and assess contemporary indicators relative to these targets, we constructed theoretical size spectra to predict pristine biomass densities using a combination of species- and size-specific nitrogen stable isotope signatures and a range of trophic efficiencies and primary productivity estimates within and among 3 sub-regions of the Newfoundland and Labrador shelf. Theoretical size spectra were compared to empirically derived size spectra using trawl survey data. The descending slopes of the empirically determined size spectra were between 1.25 and 2.42 times steeper than the theoretical slopes. The percentage of the theoretical distribution represented by the empirical size structure ranged between 1.1 and 29.4\%, with the closest and furthest estimates associated with the smallest- and largest-sized fishes, respectively, and strongly influenced by estimates of trophic efficiency and primary productivity. Regional variation was also observed, with southern regions reaching 1.3-32.3\% of the theoretical biomass density and the northernmost region reaching only 0-8.3\%. Importantly, the descending slopes varied depending on fish size, with biomass density of larger sizes decreasing faster than that of smaller sizes. Variations among sub-regions and fish guilds were also observed. These analyses provide a means to derive potential ecosystem targets and indicators through which recovery of fish communities can be monitored and assessed.},

  abstract = {Size of predator and prey determines, to a large extent, predator-prey interactions in aquatic systems. Understanding the relationship between predator and prey size in the individual predator's food selection process is a cornerstone of ecological modelling. Stomach content data are used to inform such models, as they provide prey species specific information about the predator diet in the wild. These data are strongly relevant as direct observations of species trophic interactions, but they have limitations, and are costly. Our objective was to develop and test a model which is able to predict changes in the Baltic cod diet by reconstructing the dynamics of cod and its prey, herring and sprat, populations, their length distributions, and parametrizing trophic interactions between them. We analysed time-series of cod stomach data and built an age-length structured multispecies model using Gadget. Both observed and predicted diets of smaller (juvenile) cod consisted mainly of benthos, while larger cod fed mostly on fishes (herring and sprat). Our model could predict the main patterns in species and length composition of cod diet. We also identified important knowledge gaps, especially on benthos dynamics and processes affecting prey availability and predator preference.},

  abstract = {Oceans are experiencing increasing acidification in parallel to a distinct warming trend in consequence of ongoing climate change. Rising seawater temperatures are mediating a northward shift in distribution of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), into the habitat of polar cod (Boreogadus saida), that is associated with retreating cold water masses. This study investigates the competitive strength of the co-occurring gadoids under ocean acidification and warming (OAW) scenarios. Therefore, we incubated specimens of both species in individual tanks for 4~months, under different control and projected temperatures (polar cod: 0, 3, 6, 8~\textdegree C, Atlantic cod: 3, 8, 12, 16~\textdegree C) and PCO2 conditions (390 and 1170~\textmu atm) and monitored growth, feed consumption and standard metabolic rate. Our results revealed distinct temperature effects on both species. While hypercapnia by itself had no effect, combined drivers caused nonsignificant trends. The feed conversion efficiency of normocapnic polar cod was highest at 0~\textdegree C, while optimum growth performance was attained at 6~\textdegree C; the long-term upper thermal tolerance limit was reached at 8~\textdegree C. OAW caused only slight impairments in growth performance. Under normocapnic conditions, Atlantic cod consumed progressively increasing amounts of feed than individuals under hypercapnia despite maintaining similar growth rates during warming. The low feed conversion efficiency at 3~\textdegree C may relate to the lower thermal limit of Atlantic cod. In conclusion, Atlantic cod displayed increased performance in the warming Arctic such that the competitive strength of polar cod is expected to decrease under future OAW conditions.},

  abstract = {The impact of climate change on the marine food web is highly uncertain. Nonetheless, there is growing consensus that global marine primary production will decline in response to future climate change, largely due to increased stratification reducing the supply of nutrients to the upper ocean. Evidence to date suggests a potential amplification of this response throughout the trophic food web, with more dramatic responses at higher trophic levels. Here we show that trophic amplification of marine biomass declines is a consistent feature of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) Earth System Models, across different scenarios of future climate change. Under the business-as-usual Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) global mean phytoplankton biomass is projected to decline by 6.1\% {$\pm$} 2.5\% over the twenty-first century, while zooplankton biomass declines by 13.6\% {$\pm$} 3.0\%. All models project greater relative declines in zooplankton than phytoplankton, with annual zooplankton biomass anomalies 2.24 {$\pm$} 1.03 times those of phytoplankton. The low latitude oceans drive the projected trophic amplification of biomass declines, with models exhibiting variable trophic interactions in the mid-to-high latitudes and similar relative changes in phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass. Under the assumption that zooplankton biomass is prey limited, an analytical explanation of the trophic amplification that occurs in the low latitudes can be derived from generic plankton differential equations. Using an ocean biogeochemical model, we show that the inclusion of variable C:N:P phytoplankton stoichiometry can substantially increase the trophic amplification of biomass declines in low latitude regions. This additional trophic amplification is driven by enhanced nutrient limitation decreasing phytoplankton N and P content relative to C, hence reducing zooplankton growth efficiency. Given that most current Earth System Models assume that phytoplankton C:N:P stoichiometry is constant, such models are likely to underestimate the extent of negative trophic amplification under projected climate change.},

Projected exposure of the marine ecosystem to these drivers of ocean change depends largely on the extent of future emissions, consistent with previous studies. The ESMs in CMIP6 generally project greater warming, acidification, deoxygenation, and nitrate reductions but lesser primary production declines than those from CMIP5 under comparable radiative forcing. The increased projected ocean warming results from a general increase in the climate sensitivity of CMIP6 models relative to those of CMIP5. This enhanced warming increases upper-ocean stratification in CMIP6 projections, which contributes to greater reductions in upper-ocean nitrate and subsurface oxygen ventilation. The greater surface acidification in CMIP6 is primarily a consequence of the SSPs having higher associated atmospheric CO\textsubscript{2} concentrations than their RCP analogues for the same radiative forcing. We find no consistent reduction in inter-model uncertainties, and even an increase in net primary production inter-model uncertainties in CMIP6, as compared to CMIP5.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Precise estimation of root biomass is important for understanding carbon stocks and dynamics in forests. Traditionally, biomass estimates are based on allometric scaling relationships between stem diameter and coarse root biomass calculated using linear regression (LR) on log-transformed data. Recently, it has been suggested that nonlinear regression (NLR) is a preferable fitting method for scaling relationships. But while this claim has been contested on both theoretical and empirical grounds, and statistical methods have been developed to aid in choosing between the two methods in particular cases, few studies have examined the ramifications of erroneously applying NLR. Here, we use direct measurements of 159 trees belonging to three locally dominant species in east China to compare the LR and NLR models of diameter-root biomass allometry. We then contrast model predictions by estimating stand coarse root biomass based on census data from the nearby 24-ha Gutianshan forest plot and by testing the ability of the models to predict known root biomass values measured on multiple tropical species at the Pasoh Forest Reserve in Malaysia. Based on likelihood estimates for model error distributions, as well as the accuracy of extrapolative predictions, we find that LR on log-transformed data is superior to NLR for fitting diameter-root biomass scaling models. More importantly, inappropriately using NLR leads to grossly inaccurate stand biomass estimates, especially for stands dominated by smaller trees.},

  abstract = {1. Model analyses show that the stability of population dynamics and food web persistence increase with the strength of interference competition. Despite this critical importance for community stability, little is known about how external factors such as the environmental temperature affect intraspecific interference competition. 2. We aimed to fill this void by studying the functional responses of two ground beetle species of different body size, Pterostichus melanarius and Poecilus versicolor. These functional response experiments were replicated across four predator densities and two temperatures to address the impact of temperature on intraspecific interference competition. 3. We generally expected that warming should increase the speed of movement, encounter rates and in consequence interference among predator individuals. In our experiment, this expectation was supported by the results obtained for the larger predator, P. melanarius, whereas the opposite pattern characterized the interference behaviour of the smaller predator P. versicolor. 4. These results suggest potentially nontrivial implications for the effects of environmental temperature on intraspecific interference competition, for which we propose an explanation based on the different sensitivity to warming of metabolic rates of both species. As expected, increasing temperature led to stronger interference competition of the larger species, P. melanarius, which exhibited a weaker increase in metabolic rate with increasing temperature. The stronger increase in the metabolic rate of the smaller predator, P. versicolor, had to be compensated by increasing searching activity for prey, which did not leave time for increasing interference. 5. Together, these results suggest that any generalization how interference competition responds to warming should also take the species' metabolic response to temperature increases into account.},

But modelling spatial relationships, especially in large point data sets, presents major computational challenges. We use a novel Bayesian hierarchical statistical approach, `spatial predictive process' modelling, to predict the distribution of a major invasive plant species, Celastrus orbiculatus, in the northeastern USA. The model runs orders of magnitude faster than traditional geostatistical models on a large data set of c. 4000 points, and performs better than generalized linear models, generalized additive models and geographically weighted regression in cross-validation. We also use this approach to model simultaneously the distributions of a set of four major invasive species in a spatially explicit multivariate model. This multispecies analysis demonstrates that some pairs of species exhibit negative residual spatial covariation, suggesting potential competitive interaction or divergent responses to unmeasured factors.},

In this study, we carried out a series of temperature-dependent growth experiments on juvenile Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida), an important forage fish species at the Atlantic- and Pacific-Arctic interface. Multi-week growth experiments were conducted across a range of temperatures (\`A1 to 16  C), ages (age-0 and age-1) and sizes (45\textendash 125 mm SL) to determine best-fit temperature-dependent growth models. Temperaturedependent growth models considered were 1) a single model using pooled fish of mixed ages and sizes (Model A), separate models for age 0 and age 1 fish (Model B0 and B1), and a Lorentzian three-dimensional model incorporating size but not age (Model C). All juvenile Arctic cod demonstrated relatively high growth at cold temperatures ({$<$}2  C; \$0.75\textendash 1.00\% d\`A1) with a deceleration in growth rate above 6.4  C and 9.0  C for age-1 and age-0 cod respectively. As such, Model A did not explain as much temperature-dependent growth (R2 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 51\%) as Model B0 (R2 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 98\%) and Model B1 (R2 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 93\%). Model C did reasonably well in explaining growth over a continuous range of sizes (R2 {$\frac{1}{4}$}71\%) but explained less variance than either of the age models (Model B). These results stress the importance of considering the early ontogenetic effects on temperature-dependent growth variation in juvenile Arctic cod when projecting climate-driven changes in Arctic marine ecosystems.},

In line with the temperature-size rule (TSR), marine ectotherms in warmer temperatures will grow to a smaller maximum body size, yet the extent to which different species experience this temperature-size response varies. Here, we analysed the maximum body length of ten teleost fish species in line with temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration and geographic location (that encompasses multiple latent variables), across a broad (26\textdegree ) latitudinal gradient throughout Norwegian waters. Our results showed that the two largest study species, spotted wolffish (Anarhichas minor) and cusk (Brosme brosme), display the strongest negative temperature-size response. We also observed smaller maximum body lengths for multiple species within the coldest extent of their temperature range, as well as parabolic relationships between maximum length and temperature for Atlantic wolffish (Anarhichas lupus) and beaked redfish (Sebastes mentella). The smaller maximum body lengths for high latitude species at both warm and cold temperature extremes of species' thermal ranges corroborate the temperature-size mechanisms of the gill-oxygen limitation theory (GOLT), whereby spontaneous protein denaturation limits growth at both warm and cold temperatures.},

Such models internalize body growth and mortality from predation, allowing bookkeeping of bio-mass at a detailed level of individual predation and growth and enabling scaling up to the mass balance of the ecosystem. Exploitation set independently for each species with knife-edge, size-at-entry fishing can lead to collapse of cod. Exploitation to achieve a fixed ratio of yield to productivity across species can also lead to collapse of cod. However, harvesting balanced to the overall productivity of species in the exploited ecosystem exerts a strong force countering such collapse. If balanc-ing across species is applied to a fishery with knife-edge selection, size distributions are truncated, changing the structure of the system and reducing its resilience to perturbations. If balancing is applied on the basis of productivity at each body size as well as across species, there is less disruption to size-structure, resilience is increased, and substantially greater biomass yields are possible. We note an iden-tity between the body size at which productivity is maximized and the age at which cohort biomass is maximized. In our numerical results based on detailed bookkeep-ing of biomass, cohort biomass reaches its maximum at body masses \textbackslash textless1 g, unlike standard yield-per-recruit models, where body growth and mortality are indepen-dent externalities, and cohort biomass is maximized at larger body sizes.},

Emphasis is laid on empirical formulae of the type W = aLn, and the limitations of the conventional condition factor. 2. The length-weight relationship of perch of all sizes was determined from a series of regressions of log weight on log length, and an analysis of covariance. Relative condition factors were calculated for individual fish from smoothed mean weights obtained from the regression lines. 3. In length-weight relationship it was found that the perch could be divided into a series of six groups corresponding with age, sex and maturity. Each group was generally homogeneous within itself throughout the seasons, but usually differed significantly from the other groups. Relative condition was found to vary significantly with the season. 4. At any one season the gonad weight is a constant percentage of the body weight for fish of all sizes. The seasonal changes in gonad weight are described and differ somewhat for the two sexes. Stomach contents weigh up to 2\% of the body weight in summer. 5. There is a regular seasonal cycle in condition which is at its maximum in September and minimum in early spring. The different seasonal changes in condition between mature and immature fish can largely be accounted for by the cycle in gonad weight of the former.},

  abstract = {Some recent modelling papers projecting smaller fish sizes and catches in a warmer future are based on erroneous assumptions regarding (i) the scaling of gills with body mass and (ii) the energetic cost of `maintenance'. Assumption (i) posits that insurmountable geometric constraints prevent respiratory surface areas from growing as fast as body volume. It is argued that these constraints explain allometric scaling of energy metabolism, whereby larger fishes have relatively lower mass-specific metabolic rates. Assumption (ii) concludes that when fishes reach a certain size, basal oxygen demands will not be met, because of assumption (i). We here demonstrate unequivocally, by applying accepted physiological principles with reference to the existing literature, that these assumptions are not valid. Gills are folded surfaces, where the scaling of surface area to volume is not constrained by spherical geometry. The gill surface area can, in fact, increase linearly in proportion to gill volume and body mass. We cite the large body of evidence demonstrating that respiratory surface areas in fishes reflect metabolic needs, not vice versa, which explains the large interspecific variation in scaling of gill surface areas. Finally, we point out that future studies basing their predictions on models should incorporate factors for scaling of metabolic rate and for temperature effects on metabolism, which agree with measured values, and should account for interspecific variation in scaling and temperature effects. It is possible that some fishes will become smaller in the future, but to make reliable predictions the underlying mechanisms need to be identified and sought elsewhere than in geometric constraints on gill surface area. Furthermore, to ensure that useful information is conveyed to the public and policymakers about the possible effects of climate change, it is necessary to improve communication and congruity between fish physiologists and fisheries scientists.},

We estimated the effects of these changes on biological communities using a coupled biogeochemical (PISCES) \textendash{} ecosystems (APECOSM) model forced by the physical outputs of the last generation of the IPSL-CM Earth System Model. The APECOSM model is a size-structured bio-energetic model that simulates the 3D dynamical distributions of three interactive pelagic communities (epipelagic, mesopelagic, and migratory) under the effects of multiple environmental factors. The PISCES-APECOSM model ran from 1850 to 2100 under historical forcing followed by RCP8.5. Our RCP8.5 simulation highlights significant changes in the spatial distribution, biomass, and maximum body-size of the simulated pelagic communities. Biomass and maximum body-size increase at high latitude over the course of the century, reflecting the capacity of marine organisms to respond to new suitable environment. At low- and midlatitude, biomass and maximum body-size strongly decrease. In those regions, large organisms cannot maintain their high metabolic needs because of limited and declining food availability. This resource reduction enhances the competition and modifies the biomass distribution among and within the three communities: the proportion of small organisms increases in the three communities and the migrant community that initially comprised a higher proportion of small organisms is favored. The greater resilience of small body-size organisms resides in their capacity to fulfill their metabolic needs under reduced energy supply and is further favored by the release of predation pressure due to the decline of large organisms. These results suggest that small body-size organisms might be more resilient to climate change than large ones.},

  abstract = {Due to the ephemeral nature of the atmospheric conditions over the Baltic Sea, the flow field is highly variable, and thus, changes in the resulting circulation and upwelling are difficult to observe. However, three-dimensional models, forced by realistic atmospheric conditions and river runoff, have reached such a state of accuracy that the highly fluctuating current field and the associated evolution of the temperature and salinity field can be described. In this work, effects of remote and local atmospheric forcing on circulation and upwelling in the Baltic Sea are investigated. Changes in the characteristics of the large-scale atmospheric wind field over the central and eastern North Atlantic can be described by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The NAO is related to the strength and geographical position of weather systems as they cross the North Atlantic and thus has a direct impact on the climate in Europe. To relate the local wind field over the Baltic Sea to the large-scale atmospheric circulation, we defined a Baltic Sea Index (BSI), which is the difference of normalised sea level pressures between Oslo in Norway and Szczecin in Poland. The NAO is significantly related to the BSI. Furthermore, the BSI is highly correlated with the storage variation of the Baltic Sea and the volume exchange through the Danish Sounds. Based on three-dimensional model calculations, it is shown that different phases of the NAO during winter result in major changes of horizontal transports in the deep basins of the Baltic Sea and in upwelling along the coasts as well as in the interior of the basins. During NAO+ phases, strong Ekman currents are produced with increased up- and downwelling along the coasts and associated coastal jets, whereas during NAO- phases, Ekman drift and upwelling are strongly reduced, and the flow field can almost entirely be described by the barotropic stream function. The general nature of the mean circulation in the deep basins of the Baltic Sea, obtained from a 10-yr model run, can be described by the depth integrated vorticity balance derived from the transport equation for variable depth.},

  abstract = {The Baltic Sea deep waters suffer from extended areas of hypoxia and anoxia. Their intra- and inter-annual variability is mainly determined by saline inflows which transport oxygenated water to deeper layers. During the last decades, oxygen conditions in the Baltic Sea have generally worsened and thus, the extent of hypoxic as well as anoxic bottom water has increased considerably. Climate change may further increase hypoxia due to changes in the atmospheric forcing conditions resulting in less deep water renewal Baltic inflows, decreased oxygen solubility and increased respiration rates. Feedback from climate change can amplify effects from eutrophication. A decline in oxygen conditions has generally a negative impact on marine life in the Baltic Sea. Thus, a detailed description of the evolution of oxygenated, hypoxic and anoxic areas is particularly required when studying oxygen-related processes such as habitat utilization of spawning fish, survival rates of their eggs as well as settlement probability of juveniles. One of today's major challenges is still the modeling of deep water dissolved oxygen, especially for the Baltic Sea with its seasonal and quasi-permanent extended areas of oxygen deficiency. The detailed spatial and temporal evolution of the oxygen concentrations in the entire Baltic Sea have been simulated for the period 1970\textendash 2010 by utilizing a hydrodynamic Baltic Sea model coupled to a simple pelagic and benthic oxygen consumption model. Model results are in very good agreement with CTD/O2-profiles taken in different areas of the Baltic Sea. The model proved to be a useful tool to describe the detailed evolution of oxygenated, hypoxic and anoxic areas in the entire Baltic Sea. Model results are further applied to determine frequencies of the occurrence of areas of oxygen deficiency and cod reproduction volumes.},

While sexually selected traits generally display positive allometry, a few recent reports have suggested that allometric relationships are not always linear. In male cervids, having both long antlers and large size provides benefits in terms of increased mating success. However, such attributes are costly to grow and maintain, and these costs might constrain antler length from increasing at the same rate as body mass in larger species if the quantity of energy that males can extract from their environment is limiting. We tested for possible nonlinearity in the relationship between antler size and body mass (on a log\textendash log scale) among 31 cervids and found clear deviation from linearity in the allometry of antler length. Antler length increased linearly until a male body mass threshold at approximately 110 kg. Beyond this threshold, antler length did not change with increasing mass. We discuss this evidence of nonlinear allometry in the light of life-history theory and stress the importance of testing for nonlinearity when studying allometric relationships.},

These predictions arise from consumer\textendash resource models incorporating temperature-dependent parameters, and the accuracy of these predictions hinges on the validity of temperature scalings for each parameter. Among all parameters, carrying capacity (K) is the most ill-defined and the temperature scaling of this parameter has no empirically verified foundation. Most studies assume that K declines exponentially with warming, but others have assumed a positive or no relationship between K and temperature. Here, I developed a theoretical foundation for a temperature scaling of K based on physiological principles of temperature and nutrient limitation of phytoplankton growth. The trade-off between thermodynamics and nutrient uptake yields a unimodal thermal response curve for K, and this prediction is supported by empirical data on both phytoplankton and insects. Analyses of consumer\textendash resource models demonstrate the primacy of K in determining predictions of coexistence and stability.

  abstract = {As physiological processes of ectotherms are coupled to environmental temperature, climate change will likely alter their fundamental biological rates, including metabolism, consumption, growth, and reproduction. Here we combine the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) with metabolism and consumption measurements of a model organism, the urchin Lytechinus variegatus, to test how climate change will affect consumer fitness. Unexpectedly, we found that metabolism and consumption exhibit different scaling relationships with temperature and are mismatched at high temperatures. This led to a dramatic reduction in ingestion efficiency and potentially in consumer fitness. Using meta-analysis, we showed that such temperature-driven mismatches between consumption and metabolism are common across taxa and frequently lead to reduced consumer fitness. Our empirical and synthetic analyses identify a mechanism by which climate change reduces the fitness of ectotherm consumers that may be applied to a broad array of taxonomic groups. Moreover, we showed that the assumptions of MTE do not hold at temperatures near the upper range of species' thermal tolerances for a wide array of taxa. Models using MTE to predict the effects of climate change on consumer\textendash resource dynamics may therefore be underestimating the consequences of rising temperatures on population and community dynamics.},

Here, we introduce BioShifts\textemdash a global geo-database of 30,534 range shifts. Despite a spatial imbalance towards the most developed regions of the Northern Hemisphere and a taxonomic bias towards the most charismatic animals and plants of the planet, data show that marine species are better at tracking isotherm shifts, and move towards the pole six times faster than terrestrial species. More specifically, we find that marine species closely track shifting isotherms in warm and relatively undisturbed waters (for example, the Central Pacific Basin) or in cold waters subject to high human pressures (for example, the North Sea). On land, human activities impede the capacity of terrestrial species to track isotherm shifts in latitude, with some species shifting in the opposite direction to isotherms. Along elevational gradients, species follow the direction of isotherm shifts but at a pace that is much slower than expected, especially in areas with warm climates. Our results suggest that terrestrial species are lagging behind shifting isotherms more than marine species, which is probably related to the interplay between the wider thermal safety margin of terrestrial versus marine species and the more constrained physical environment for dispersal in terrestrial versus marine habitats.},

We show that the parameters of the VB equation are simple functions of age at maturity and reproductive investment. We use this model to show how the energy demands for both growth and reproduction trade off to determine optimal life-history traits. Assuming that both age at maturity and reproductive investment adapt to variations in adult mortality to maximize lifetime offspring production, our model predicts that: (i) the optimal age of maturity is inversely related to adult mortality rate; (ii) the optimal reproductive effort is approximately equal to adult mortality rate. These predictions are consistent with observed variations in the life-history traits of a large sample of iteroparous freshwater fishes.},

  abstract = {Climate change is anticipated to have multiple consequences for aquatic ectotherms. Warming temperatures, for example, are predicted to reduce body size in many fish species. Smaller sizes may be caused by physiological constraints associated with respiration, life-history responses to faster growth and concomitant earlier age at maturity, and interactive effects of fishing and climate change on evolution. Here, using a phylogenetically broad dataset of 100 marine species, we explore how natural mortality might respond to a 10\% reduction in asymptotic length (L{$\infty$}). We find that this decrease in size (predicted to be associated with a 1 \textdegree C ocean temperature increase) is likely to exacerbate natural mortality (M) for most marine fishes, albeit not all, on Canada's Scotian Shelf. Across all bony fishes (Actinopterygii), the median proportional increase in natural mortality is 10.5\%; limited data suggest that chondrichthyans are less affected. Smaller-bodied fish species experienced greater absolute increases in M than larger-bodied species. Among commercially exploited species for which sufficient data are available, M is predicted to increase by 0.14 for Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus), 0.08 for Silver hake (Merluccius bilinearis), 0.04 for Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), and 0.02 for Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and Pollock (Pollachias virens). The present study offers a simple means of exploring the mortality consequences of reduced body size hypothesized to result from globally warming water temperatures, thus contributing a potential tool for climate-change vulnerability assessments of marine fishes.},

Although the oxygen-temperature interaction may provide new insight into proximate and evolutionary constraints on embryonic development and offspring fitness, it has rarely been studied in oviparous amniotes. We used a two-factor experiment [three oxygen concentrations (12, 22 and 30\%) x two temperatures (26.5 and 34 degrees C)] to identify the effect of the oxygen-temperature interaction on embryonic development and hatchling traits in the Chinese soft-shelled turtle, Pelodiscus sinensis. When eggs were incubated at the critically high temperature, hatching success of turtle eggs was enhanced by hyperoxia but reduced by hypoxia; this result was not observed in eggs incubated at the benign temperature. Hypoxia retarded embryonic development, and reduced body size, locomotor performance and survival rate of hatchings at the critically high temperature. However, the effects of hypoxia were greatly reduced at the benign temperature. Our study demonstrates that oxygen and temperature interact to affect not only the heat tolerance and developmental rate of embryos but also the fitness-related traits of hatchlings, suggesting that interactions among environmental factors impose significant ecological constraints on embryonic development in oviparous amniotes.},

Apart from overfishing, the causes of this decline and its subsequent lack of recovery remain largely unresolved. Indeed, the degree to which specific habitats are important for this species remains unquantified at the scale of North Atlantic. Here, the literature on the role of eelgrass meadows (Zostera marina) as valuable nursery habitat for the Atlantic cod is reviewed and synthesized. Evidence is presented on relative densities of Atlantic cod in shallow water environments and in eelgrass meadows in comparison to alternative habitats. In addition, evidence pertaining to the 'viability gains' attributed to the use of eelgrass meadows as nursery habitat (growth and survival) by juvenile Atlantic cod is analyzed. Although juvenile Atlantic cod use of Z. marina is found to be facultative, when possible, available literatures indicates that they may select Z. marina as a nursery habitat where they are found in high density (average of at least 246~ha-1). From their use of Z. marina habitat the juvenile Atlantic cod receives viability benefits from it, improving their chances of reaching maturation. This paper provides strong evidence that eelgrass meadows are of significant importance to contributing to Atlantic cod stocks.},

Air turbulence is thought to be the main cause for collisions of similar-sized droplets exceeding radii of a few micrometres, and therefore rain prediction requires a quantitative description of droplet collision in turbulence. Turbulent vortices act as small centrifuges that spin heavy droplets out, creating concentration inhomogeneities and jets of droplets, both of which increase the mean collision rate. Here we derive a formula for the collision rate of small heavy particles in a turbulent flow, using a recently developed formalism for tracing random trajectories. We describe an enhancement of inertial effects by turbulence intermittency and an interplay between turbulence and gravity that determines the collision rate. We present a new mechanism, the 'sling effect', for collisions due to jets of droplets that become detached from the air flow. We conclude that air turbulence can substantially accelerate the appearance of large droplets that trigger rain.},

Eastern Baltic cod has experienced a strong decline in mean body condition (i.e. weight at a specific length) over the past 20 years with effects on the fishery relying on this resource. The decrease in cod condition has been tentatively linked in the literature to increased hypoxic areas potentially affecting habitat range, but also to benthic prey and/or cod physiology directly. To date, no studies have been performed to test these mechanisms. Using otolith trace element microchemistry and hypoxia-responding metrics based on manganese (Mn) and magnesium (Mg), we investigated the relationship between fish body condition at capture and exposure to hypoxia. Cod individuals collected after 2000 with low body condition had a higher level of Mn/Mg in the last year of life, indicating higher exposure to hypoxic waters than cod with high body condition. Moreover, lifetime exposure to hypoxia was even more strongly correlated to body condition, suggesting that condition may reflect long-term hypoxia status. These results were irrespective of fish age or sex. This implies that as Baltic cod visit poor-oxygen waters, perhaps searching for benthic food, they compromise their own performance. This study specifically sheds light on the mechanisms leading to the low condition of cod and generally points to the impact of deoxygenation on ecosystems and fisheries.},

It is applied to cod (Gadus morhua) in the Baltic Sea, which is vulnerable to climate-related decline in salinity owing to both direct and indirect effects (i.e. through species interactions) on early-life survival. A stochastic food web-model driven by regional climate scenarios is used to produce quantitative forecasts of cod dynamics in the twenty-first century.

Failing to acknowledge that such species may be composed of distinct populations may result in overestimation of the stock's true harvest potential. To avoid overexploitation, ways to identify population structuring are therefore needed.

Specifically, we compiled and standardized multiple trawl-survey data sets and used a range of statistical tools to assess whether the current management boundaries adequately account for potential population structuring. Our results demonstrate regional differences in spatial abundance patterns, temporal dynamics and population demographics. These findings are in line with recent genetic studies of sprat, indicating reproductive isolation between the Baltic Sea/Kattegat and a larger cluster containing the North-, Irish-, Celtic Sea, and Bay of Biscay. Since relying on routinely collected survey data, our statistical approach can be a cost-effective complement to population genetic methods for detecting population structuring. These can be used to guide spatial management efforts and ensure sustainable exploitation, especially under climate change and the expected changes in species distributions across current management borders.},

  abstract = {Summary. Continuously indexed Gaussian fields (GFs) are the most important ingredient in spatial statistical modelling and geostatistics. The specification through the covariance function gives an intuitive interpretation of the field properties. On the computational side, GFs are hampered with the big n problem, since the cost of factorizing dense matrices is cubic in the dimension. Although computational power today is at an all time high, this fact seems still to be a computational bottleneck in many applications. Along with GFs, there is the class of Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRFs) which are discretely indexed. The Markov property makes the precision matrix involved sparse, which enables the use of numerical algorithms for sparse matrices, that for fields in only use the square root of the time required by general algorithms. The specification of a GMRF is through its full conditional distributions but its marginal properties are not transparent in such a parameterization. We show that, using an approximate stochastic weak solution to (linear) stochastic partial differential equations, we can, for some GFs in the Mat\'ern class, provide an explicit link, for any triangulation of , between GFs and GMRFs, formulated as a basis function representation. The consequence is that we can take the best from the two worlds and do the modelling by using GFs but do the computations by using GMRFs. Perhaps more importantly, our approach generalizes to other covariance functions generated by SPDEs, including oscillating and non-stationary GFs, as well as GFs on manifolds. We illustrate our approach by analysing global temperature data with a non-stationary model defined on a sphere.},

  abstract = {Resolving the combined effect of climate warming and exploitation in a food web context is key for predicting future biomass production, size-structure, and potential yields of marine fishes. Previous studies based on mechanistic size-based food web models have found that bottom-up processes are important drivers of size-structure and fisheries yield in changing climates. However, we know less about the joint effects of `bottom-up' and `top-down' effects of temperature: how do temperature effects propagate from individual-level physiology through food webs and alter the size-structure of exploited species in a community? Here we assess how a species-resolved size-based food web is affected by warming through both these pathways, and by exploitation. We parameterize a dynamic size spectrum food web model inspired by the offshore Baltic Sea food web, and investigate how individual growth rates, size-structure, relative abundances of species and yields are affected by warming. The magnitude of warming is based on projections by the regional coupled model system RCA4-NEMO and the RCP 8.5 emission scenario, and we evaluate different scenarios of temperature dependence on fish physiology and resource productivity. When accounting for temperature-effects on physiology in addition to on basal productivity, projected size-at-age in 2050 increases on average for all fish species, mainly for young fish, compared to scenarios without warming. In contrast, size-at-age decreases when temperature affects resource dynamics only, and the decline is largest for young fish. Faster growth rates due to warming, however, do not always translate to larger yields, as lower resource carrying capacities with increasing temperature tend to result in declines in the abundance of larger fish and hence spawning stock biomass \textendash{} the part of the population exposed to fishing. These results show that to understand how global warming impacts the size structure of fish communities, both direct metabolic effects and indirect effects of temperature via basal resources must be accounted for.},

  abstract = {An organism's body condition describes its mass given its length and is often positively associated with fitness. The condition of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in the Baltic Sea has declined dramatically since the early 1990s, possibly due to increased competition, food limitation, and hypoxia. However, the effect of biotic and abiotic variables on body condition have not been evaluated at local scales, which is important given spatial heterogeneity. We evaluate changes in distribution, experienced environmental conditions, and individual-level condition of cod in relation to covariates at different spatial scales using geostatistical models with spatial and spatiotemporal random effects. Oxygen, sprat biomass, and temperature were positively related to condition, and depth negatively associated, but the effect sizes of these variables were small\textemdash spatial and spatiotemporal latent variables explained almost five times more variation than fixed effects. We also show that accounting for the heterogenous distribution of cod leads to both lover levels and steeper trends over time in experienced oxygen compared to those in the environment. Understanding the drivers of spatiotemporal variation in body condition is critical for predicting responses to environmental change and to effective fishery management; yet low explanatory power of covariates on individual condition constitutes a major challenge.},

  abstract = {Ectotherms are predicted to ``shrink'' with global warming, in line with general growth models and the temperature-size rule (TSR), both predicting smaller adult sizes with warming. However, they also predict faster juvenile growth rates and thus larger size-at-age of young organisms. Hence, the result of warming on the size-structure of a population depends on the interplay between how mortality rate, juvenile- and adult growth rates are affected by warming. Here, we use two-decade long time series of biological samples from a unique enclosed bay heated by cooling water from a nearby nuclear power plant to become 5\textendash 10 \textdegree C warmer than its reference area. We used growth-increment biochronologies (12658 reconstructed length-at-age estimates from 2426 individuals) to quantify how {$>$}20 years of warming has affected body growth and size-at-age and catch data to quantify mortality rates and population size- and age structure of Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis). In the heated area, growth rates were faster for all sizes, and hence size-at-age was larger for all ages, compared to the reference area. While mortality rates were also higher (lowering mean age by 0.4 years), the faster growth rates lead to a 2 cm larger mean size in the heated area. Differences in the size-spectrum exponent (describing the proportion of fish by size) were less clear statistically. Our analyses reveal that mortality, in addition to plastic growth and size-responses, is a key factor determining the size structure of populations exposed to warming. Understanding the mechanisms by which warming affects the size- and age structure of populations is critical for predicting the impacts of climate change on ecological functions, interactions, and dynamics.},

Food-dependent growth and within-species size variation depend on temperature and affect community dynamics through feedbacks between individual performance and population size structure. Still, we know little about how warming affects these feedbacks. Using a dynamic stage-structured biomass model with food-, size- and temperature-dependent life history processes, we analyse how temperature affects coexistence, stability and size structure in a tri-trophic food chain, and find that warming effects on community stability depend on ecological interactions. Predator biomass densities generally decline with warming \textendash gradually or through collapses \textendash{} depending on which consumer life stage predators feed on. Collapses occur when warming induces alternative stable states via Allee effects. This suggests that predator persistence in warmer climates may be lower than previously acknowledged and that effects of warming on food web stability largely depend on species interactions.},

Here, we investigate the consequences of interactive temperature- and size scaling of vital rates for the dynamics of populations experiencing warming using a stage-structured consumer-resource model. We show that interactive scaling alters population and stage-specific responses to rising temperatures, such that warming can induce shifts in population regulation and stage-structure, influence community structure and govern population responses to mortality. Analysing experimental data for 20 fish species, we found size-temperature interactions in intraspecific scaling of metabolic rate to be common. Given the evidence for size-temperature interactions and the ubiquity of size structure in animal populations, we argue that accounting for size-specific temperature effects is pivotal for understanding how warming affects animal populations and communities.},

Previous studies based on mechanistic size-based food web models have found that bottom-up processes are important drivers of size-structure and fisheries yield in changing climates. However, we know less about the joint effects of bottom-up and physiological effects of temperature; how do temperature effects propagate from individual-level physiology through food webs and alter the size-structure of exploited species in a community? Here we assess how a species-resolved size-based food web is affected by warming through both these pathways, and by exploitation. We parameterize a dynamic size spectrum food web model inspired by the offshore Baltic Sea food web, and investigate how individual growth rates, size-structure, relative abundances of species and yields are affected by warming. The magnitude of warming is based on projections by the regional coupled model system RCA4-NEMO and the RCP 8.5 emission scenario, and we evaluate different scenarios of temperature dependence on fish physiology and resource productivity. When accounting for temperature-effects on physiology in addition to on basal productivity, projected size-at-age in 2050 increases on average for all fish species, mainly for young fish, compared to scenarios without warming. In contrast, size-at-age decreases when temperature affects resource dynamics only, and the decline is largest for young fish. Faster growth rates due to warming, however, do not always translate to larger yields, as lower resource carrying capacities with increasing temperature tend to result in declines in the abundance of larger fish and hence spawning stock biomass. These results suggest that to understand how global warming affects the size structure of fish communities, both direct metabolic effects and indirect effects of temperature via basal resources must be accounted for.},

  abstract = {Among species interactions, competition is obviously more nuanced to investigate than predation. Certainly there have been copious, seminal works on competition in marine and freshwater ecosystems, most often on research executed at smaller ecological scales such as rocky intertidal zones, coral reefs, or littoral zones, and often involving experimental manipulation. Such studies have typically emphasized organisms with relatively high site fidelity, and all have focused primarily at the individual level. Here we springboard from those studies to explore competition among marine fishes at broader spatiotemporal scales, scales at which fish populations are distributed, scales at which their associated fisheries operate and are managed, and as observed under ambient (i.e., nonexperimental) system dynamics. Inferring that competition might be occurring among marine fishes requires four conditions: opposite population trajectories, high spatiotemporal overlap, high dietary overlap, and some indication of resource limitation. We used those criteria to examine cases of species pairings from the Northeast United States Large Marine Ecosystem to ascertain if there are broadly applicable rules of thumb to determine when competition might be a significant consideration. We assert that such rules exist, and where competition is strongly suspected, we provide an empirically based method of calculating first-order, model-free interaction terms that can scope the potential magnitude of competitive effects. We do so very much cognizant of several caveats and theoretical considerations; but our main premise is that estimating and evaluating competition for marine fishes from extant, commonly available data is feasible, is highly germane, and has many valuable applications for multispecies and ecosystem models as we move toward ecosystem-based fisheries management.},

We report fundamental differences in size distributions of marine and freshwater diatoms, with marine diatoms significantly larger than freshwater species. An evolutionary game theoretical model with empirical allometries of growth and nutrient uptake shows that these differences can be explained by nitrogen versus phosphorus limitation, nutrient fluctuations and mixed layer depth differences. Constant and pulsed phosphorus supply select for small sizes, as does constant nitrogen supply. In contrast, intermediate frequency nitrogen pulses common in the ocean select for large sizes or the evolutionarily stable coexistence of large and small sizes. Size-dependent sinking interacts with mixed layer depth (MLD) to further modulate optimal sizes, with smaller sizes selected for by strong sinking and shallow MLD. In freshwaters, widespread phosphorus limitation, together with strong sinking and shallow MLD produce size distributions with smaller range, means and upper values, compared with the ocean. Shifting patterns of nutrient limitation and mixing may alter diatom size distributions, affecting global carbon cycle and the structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems.},

We document a biochemical effect of climate-induced community transitions in boreal oceans: opposite population trajectories of lipid-rich and lipid-poor fish species. We compared published estimates of fish lipid content and population trajectories following climate shifts in 4 areas (Bering Sea, Gulf of Alaska, Scotian Shelf and North Sea). In all cases, total lipid content differed between species that increased and decreased in abundance, and the resulting relatively lipid-rich or lipid-poor communities persisted for decades. We hypothesize that these changes in fish community lipid content are the result of climate-mediated changes in the availability of essential fatty acids (EFAs), which are required by fish as components of hormones and cell membranes. EFAs are produced only by plants and must be obtained by fish through their diet, and ecosystem EFA availability is sensitive to physical forcing mechanisms. Using original data from 5 species of northeast Pacific fish (total lipid 1.0 to 28.9\% wet mass) and published data for 29 species of myctophids (total lipid 0.5 to 46.3\% wet mass), we found that the content of 2 important EFAs was positively correlated with total lipid content. This result suggests the possibility of species differences in EFA requirements that are related to total lipid content, and possible differences in susceptibility to changing EFA availability in lipid-rich and lipid-poor fish species.},

European hake (Merluccius merluccius) is one of the most important target species in the Mediterranean Sea and is largely overexploited by industrial fisheries. Here, we used two methodological approaches to further investigate the seasonal variation in the spatial distribution of European hake considering ontogenetic changes and trophic ecology in the western Mediterranean Sea. Our main aim was to explore if spatial changes in hake distribution were related to trophic behaviour, in addition to key environmental factors. We employed a hierarchical Bayesian species distribution modelling approach (B-SDM), using spatial data from two oceanographic surveys conducted during winter and summer. We analysed how the environmental variables, together with abundance and mean weight distribution of the main preys identified for European hake, affected the seasonal distribution of the species. Results revealed clear differences in the distribution of the European hake between seasons, which were indeed partially correlated to the distribution of their main preys, in addition to the environment. Stable isotope values and Bayesian isotopic mixing models (MixSIAR) revealed substantial seasonal and ontogenetic differences in trophic habits of European hake, partly matching the spatial distribution results. These findings could have implications for a future seasonal-based adaptive fisheries management, as local depletion of prey, or variation in size and condition may affect European hake presence in this area. Moreover, this study illustrates how the sequential application of methodologies provides a more holistic understanding of species seasonality, which is essential to understand the phenological processes of exploited species and their potential shifts due to environmental changes.},

To put this pressure on species into context, a novel index designed to quantify climate change in the coming century has been developed. Its value gives the local velocity along the Earth's surface needed to maintain constant temperatures, and is derived from temperature gradients scaled by distance (\textdegree C per km) and time (\textdegree C per year). The index provides a quantitative view of the role of topography in buffering climate change as it would affect plants and animals: on the IPCC's A1B emission scenario the index has a global mean of 0.42 km per year, compared to extremes of 0.08 and 1.26 km per year for mountains forest biomes and flooded grasslands, respectively. Climate change velocity, it turns out, is large relative to species migration speeds and the sizes of protected habitats. The data suggest that, in some ecosystems, helping species to relocate more rapidly via habitat corridors or new reserves could be an important contribution to conservation.},

The prediction of how global climate change will modify this metabolic balance of the oceans is limited by the lack of a comprehensive underlying theory. Here, we show that the balance between production and respiration is profoundly affected by environmental temperature. We extend the general metabolic theory of ecology to the production and respiration of oceanic communities and show that ecosystem rates can be reliably scaled from theoretical knowledge of organism physiology and measurement of population abundance. Our theory predicts that the differential temperature-dependence of respiration and photosynthesis at the organism level determines the response of the metabolic balance of the epipelagic ocean to changes in ambient temperature, a prediction that we support with empirical data over the global ocean. Furthermore, our model predicts that there will be a negative feedback of ocean communities to climate warming because they will capture less CO2 with a future increase in ocean temperature. This feedback of marine biota will further aggravate the anthropogenic effects on global warming.},

  abstract = {Modeling of body growth forms an essential part of many fisheries stock assessments. Growth influences population dynamics through its effects on lifetime patterns of biomass production, natural and fishing mortality, and reproductive output. By relating size to age, growth models also enable the use of size-based data in age-based stock assessments. Growth patterns are commonly assumed to be constant (time-invariant) or at best subject to inconsequential process noise. However, fish growth is inherently plastic, often responding strongly to environmental conditions such as temperature and food availability. In wild fish stocks, this results in median temporal variation of around 15\% in length-at-age and 40\% in weight-at-age, with extremes of 20\% (length) and 60\% (weight). Plasticity mediates environmental forcing and density-dependence in growth, both of which can have important implications for stock assessment and management. Failing to account for such effects can lead to substantial deviations (often more than 30\%) in reconstructed stock dynamics, projections and reference points. The nature and magnitude of such deviations depends not only on the statistical adequacy of the growth model but on how growth information is used in the stock assessment process and on the management options being evaluated. In addition to having direct assessment and management consequences, plasticity provides a unified conceptual framework for interpreting various disparate and at times, confusing patterns of fish growth. Therefore, I conclude that the ``constant growth'' paradigm of fisheries stock assessments should be replaced with a paradigm that embraces growth plasticity and its consequences.},

  abstract = {Natural mortality rates (M) in fish populations vary with body size and age, often by orders of magnitude over the life cycle. Traditionally, fisheries models and stock assessment methods have treated M as constant in the recruited stock, but that axiom has been challenged on empirical and theoretical grounds, and by practical assessment needs. Reviewing biological considerations, empirical generalizations, and theoretical models of size- and age-dependent natural mortality in fish populations, I show how multiple strands of evidence lead to a coherent new M paradigm best described as `generalized length-inverse mortality' (GLIM). GLIM holds that mortality declines inversely with body length throughout much of the juvenile and adult phases of the fish lifecycle. Deviations from the length-inverse pattern may occur in older ages due to senescence and in early juveniles due to density-dependence. GLIM is strongly supported by empirical meta-analyses of mortality-size relationships and is also broadly consistent with multi-species and ecosystem models of predation mortality. Whether operationalized in closed functional form or through multi-species modeling of predation and residual mortality, GLIM provides a new `standard M{${'}$} for fish population modeling and stock assessment applications. Consequences of mis-specifying size- and age-dependent M in stock assessment applications vary from moderate in many cases to severe under certain conditions, but even moderate consequences can be quantitatively significant in stock assessment and management. Further research is indicated with regards to senescence and to the representation of residual or non-predation mortality (M1) in multi-species and ecosystem models.},

  abstract = {Abstract Modern aquaculture recirculation systems (RASs) are a necessary tool to provide sustainable and continuous aquaculture production with low environmental impact. But, productivity and efficiency of such RAS still have to be optimized to ensure economic viability, putting growth performance into the focus. Growth is often reported as absolute (gain per day), relative (percentage increase in size) or specific growth rate (percentage increase in size per day), based on stocking and harvesting data. These functions describe growth very simplified and are inaccu- rate because intermediate growth data are not considered. In contrast, nonlinear growth models attempt to provide information of growth across different life stages. On the basis of an empirical RAS data set of 150 all-female turbot reared in an RAS during a period of 340 days of outgrowth, this paper reviews the most commonly used growth rates (relative, absolute, specific), the thermal-unit growth coefficient and five nonlinear growth functions (logistic, Gompertz, von Bertalanffy, Kanis and Schnute). Goodness of fit is expressed by R2 and as mean percentage deviation. Nonlinear growth models are also compared by their resid- ual standard error (RSE) and the Akaike information criterion. All processed functions are modelled to illustrate the shape of the generated curve and the pos- sibility of the function to realistically predict growth. Further, the biological meaning of their regression parameters is discussed. This way we can point out differences in nonlinear growth models in contrast to purely descriptive growth rates and the specific advantages, disadvantages and possible applications of each function we review.},

The range of PGY harvesting strategies is generally broad and thus leaves room to account for additional objectives besides high yield. Here, we analyze stage-dependent harvesting strategies that realize PGY with conservation as a second objective. We show that (1) PGY harvesting strategies can give large conservation benefits and (2) equal harvesting rates of juveniles and adults is often a good strategy. These conclusions are based on trade-off curves between yield and four measures of conservation that form in two established population models, one age-structured model and one stage-structured model, when considering different harvesting rates of juveniles and adults. These conclusions hold for a broad range of parameter settings, although our investigation of robustness also reveals that (3) predictions of the age-structured model are more sensitive to variations in parameter values than those of the stage-structured model. Finally, we find that (4) measures of stability that are often quite difficult to assess in the field (e.g., basic reproduction ratio and resilience) are systematically negatively correlated with impacts on biomass and size structure, so that these later quantities can provide integrative signals to detect possible collapses.},

  abstract = {Processes controlling the production of new fish (recruitment) are poorly understood and therefore challenge population ecologists and resource managers. Sprat in the Baltic Sea is no exception: recruitment varies widely between years and is virtually independent of the biomass of mature sprat. Sprat is a key prey and predator species in the Baltic ecosystem and is commercially exploited (1.86 \texttimes{} 108 kg/yr since 1974). The population and fishery must therefore be managed sustainably and if necessary accommodate environmental effects on population dynamics. We demonstrate using 45 years of data that recruitment depends on temperature conditions during the months when sprat gonads, eggs, and larvae are developing. We also show that recruitment can be predicted before adults spawn (and fully 15 months earlier than using present technology) by using linkages between recruitment, large-scale climate variability (North Atlantic Oscillation), Baltic Sea ice coverage, and water temperature. These relationships increase our understanding of sprat population dynamics and enable a desirable integration of fisheries ecology and management with climatology and oceanography.},

  abstract = {The Baltic Sea is a large brackish semienclosed sea whose species-poor fish community supports important commercial and recreational fisheries. Both the fish species and the fisheries are strongly affected by climate variations. These climatic effects and the underlying mechanisms are briefly reviewed. We then use recent regional \textendash{} scale climate \textendash{} ocean modelling results to consider how climate change during this century will affect the fish community of the Baltic and fisheries management. Expected climate changes in northern Europe will likely affect both the temperature and salinity of the Baltic, causing it to become warmer and fresher. As an estuarine ecosystem with large horizontal and vertical salinity gradients, biodiversity will be particularly sensitive to changes in salinity which can be expected as a consequence of altered precipitation patterns. Marine-tolerant species will be disadvantaged and their distributions will partially contract from the Baltic Sea; habitats of freshwater species will likely expand. Although some new species can be expected to immigrate because of an expected increase in sea temperature, only a few of these species will be able to successfully colonize the Baltic because of its low salinity. Fishing fleets which presently target marine species (e.g. cod, herring, sprat, plaice, sole) in the Baltic will likely have to relocate to more marine areas or switch to other species which tolerate decreasing salinities. Fishery management thresholds that trigger reductions in fishing quotas or fishery closures to conserve local populations (e.g. cod, salmon) will have to be reassessed as the ecological basis on which existing thresholds have been established changes, and new thresholds will have to be developed for immigrant species. The Baltic situation illustrates some of the uncertainties and complexities associated with forecasting how fish populations, communities and industries dependent on an estuarine ecosystem might respond to future climate change.},

However, in many key areas of fisheries science (e.g. growth, survival and recruitment determination), environmental heterogeneity is usually ignored because of insufficient environmental or fisheries data or lack of evidence that such heterogeneity impacts response variables. For the eastern Baltic Sea (ICES Subdivisions 25 to 32), we evaluated spatial and temporal differences in conditions affecting the survival of cod Gadus morhua L. eggs at survival on four distinct spawning sites within the assessment area. We intercalibrated ways of quantifying the volume of water ('reproductive volume') at each site where salinity, oxygen and temperature conditions permitted successful egg development. We have developed and compared a time series (1952 to 1996) of reproductive volumes among the areas to identify spatial differences. The results of 2 independent volume-estimation methods are comparable, indicating that highly significant differences exist among the sites, and that the westernmost spawning ground, Bornholm Basin, has on average the highest reproductive volume and the lowest variability among the 4 sites. These findings may be useful in evaluating how spatial and temporal variability in environmental conditions affect egg hatching success and possibly recruitment in the Baltic stock.}

Within 100 generations (c. 1 year), we generated a fourfold difference in cell volume among selected lineages. Large-selected populations produced four times the energy than small-selected populations of equivalent total biovolume, but at the cost of much higher volume-specific respiration. These differences in energy utilisation between large (more productive) and small (more energy-efficient) individuals were used to successfully predict ecological performance (r and K) across novel resource regimes. We show that body size determines the performance of a species by mediating its net energy flux, with worrying implications for current trends in size reduction and for global carbon cycles.},

The system has been set-up using the NEMO model (Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean). New developments have been incorporated in NEMO to make it suitable to open- as well as coastal-ocean modelling. In this paper, we pursue three main objectives: (1) to give an overview of the model configuration used for the simulations; (2) to give a broad-brush account of one particular aspect of this work, namely consistency verification; this type of validation is conducted upstream of the implementation of the system before it is used for production and routinely validated; it is meant to guide model development in identifying gross deficiencies in the modelling of several key physical processes; and (3) to show that such a regional modelling system has potential as a complement to patchy observations (an integrated approach) to give information on non-observed physical quantities and to provide links between observations by identifying broader-scale patterns and processes. We concentrate on the year 2008. We first provide domain-wide consistency verification results in terms of barotropic tides, transports, sea surface temperature and stratification. We then focus on two dynamical subregions: the Celtic shelves and the Bay of Biscay slope and deep regions. The model\textendash data consistency is checked for variables and processes such as tidal currents, tidal fronts, internal tides and residual elevation. We also examine the representation in the model of a seasonal pattern of the Bay of Biscay circulation: the warm extension of the Iberian Poleward Current along the northern Spanish coast (Navidad event) in the winter of 2007\textendash 2008.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The validity of this assumption is in question for long-lived gadoid stocks; however, estimating total egg production independently of spawner biomass is seldom feasible. An alternative approach is to examine correlations between recruitment and variables likely to be proxies for total egg production by the stock. This indirect approach was used for haddock on the Scotian Shelf. Indices of growth (mean length at age-4) and condition (weight at 50 cm) were used as proxies for the reproductive potential of individual spawners. Both variables were positively correlated with recruitment over a 3-decade period (1964-1995). During the same time period, there was no relationship between recruitment and spawner biomass estimated by Virtual Population Analysis (VPA). This is further evidence that VPA-based spawner biomass is a poor index of the true reproductive potential of the stock. The results highlight the need to develop more accurate/precise measures of total egg production for use in recruitment research.},

The models that guide the management of these fisheries almost always assume reproduction is proportional to mass (isometry), when fecundity generally increases disproportionately to mass (hyperallometry). Judged against several management reference points, we show that assuming isometry overestimates the replenishment potential of exploited fish stocks by 22\% (range: 2\% to 78\%) for 32 of the world's largest fisheries, risking systematic overharvesting. We calculate that target catches based on assumptions of isometry are more than double those based on assumptions of hyperallometry for most species, such that common reference points are set twice as high as they should be to maintain the target level of replenishment. We also show that hyperallometric reproduction provides opportunities for increasing the efficacy of tools that are underused in standard fisheries management, such as protected areas or harvest slot limits. Adopting management strategies that conserve large, hyperfecund fish may, in some instances, result in higher yields relative to traditional approaches. We recommend that future assessment of reference points and quotas include reproductive hyperallometry unless there is clear evidence that it does not occur in that species.},

  abstract = {Model-based prediction of fish distribution at fine resolutions in space and time has the potential to inform area-based and dynamic forms of management, such as permanent marine protected areas or real-time temporary closures. A major limitation to the spatial and temporal mapping resolution that is achievable is the amount of high quality, standardised data that can be utilized for fitting statistical models. To achieve an adequate spatio-temporal resolution from sparse data, one option is pooling information from several sources, such as scientific surveys and fisheries data. Because surveys and fisheries data usually use different sampling methods, pooling information from different sources requires cross-calibration of catch rates values across multiple gears. However, the individual gear efficiency and selectivity curves (the ratio between catch and availability at a given length) for all fishing gears and species are typically unknown. Using cod (Gadus morhua) in the northern North Sea as a case study, we developed a new formulation of spatio-temporal generalised additive models (GAM) of relative abundance of fish, combining catch data from multiple sources. Differences in gear efficiency and selectivity were internally calibrated within the model by the estimation of the local spatio-temporal variation in abundance. We show that pooling data sources enables the prediction of multi-annual and seasonal spatial variation in cod relative abundance-at-size, at spatio-temporal resolutions that are relevant for informing fishing strategies, e.g., reducing bycatch in real-time, or management objectives, e.g., real-time closed areas. We also show that GAM models fit to catch and effort data can reveal the relative efficiency and selectivity of different survey and commercial gears. The selectivity curve estimates that emerged as a by-product of our analysis are consistent with expert knowledge of the performance of the gears employed for cod. Our analytical approach can therefore serve two useful purposes: to estimate spatio-temporal variation in relative abundance of fish and to estimate relative gear efficiency and selectivity.},

These temperatures are assumed to be optimal and therefore to match body temperatures (Trmax) that maximize fitness (r). We develop an optimality model and find that optimal body temperature (T(o)) should not be centered at Trmax but shifted to a lower temperature. This finding seems paradoxical but results from two considerations relating to Jensen's inequality, which deals with how variance and skew influence integrals of nonlinear functions. First, ectotherms are not perfect thermoregulators and so experience a range of T(b). Second, temperature-fitness curves are asymmetric, such that a T(b) higher than Trmax depresses fitness more than will a T(b) displaced an equivalent amount below Trmax. Our model makes several predictions. The magnitude of the optimal shift (Trmax - To) should increase with the degree of asymmetry of temperature-fitness curves and with T(b) variance. Deviations should be relatively large for thermal specialists but insensitive to whether fitness increases with Trmax ("hotter is better"). Asymmetric (left-skewed) T(b) distributions reduce the magnitude of the optimal shift but do not eliminate it. Comparative data (insects, lizards) support key predictions. Thus, "suboptimal" is optimal.},

  abstract = {Individual metabolism, predator\textendash prey relationships, and the role of biodiversity are major factors underlying the dynamics of food webs and their response to environmental variability. Despite their crucial, complementary and interacting influences, they are usually not considered simultaneously in current marine ecosystem models. In an attempt to fill this gap and determine if these factors and their interaction are sufficient to allow realistic community structure and dynamics to emerge, we formulate a mathematical model of the size-structured dynamics of marine communities which integrates mechanistically individual, population and community levels. The model represents the transfer of energy generated in both time and size by an infinite number of interacting fish species spanning from very small to very large species. It is based on standard individual level assumptions of the Dynamic Energy Budget theory (DEB) as well as important ecological processes such as opportunistic size-based predation and competition for food. Resting on the inter-specific body-size scaling relationships of the DEB theory, the diversity of life-history traits (i.e. biodiversity) is explicitly integrated. The stationary solutions of the model as well as the transient solutions arising when environmental signals (e.g. variability of primary production and temperature) propagate through the ecosystem are studied using numerical simulations. It is shown that in the absence of density-dependent feedback processes, the model exhibits unstable oscillations. Density-dependent schooling probability and schooling-dependent predatory and disease mortalities are proposed to be important stabilizing factors allowing stationary solutions to be reached. At the community level, the shape and slope of the obtained quasi-linear stationary spectrum matches well with empirical studies. When oscillations of primary production are simulated, the model predicts that the variability propagates along the spectrum in a given frequency-dependent size range before decreasing for larger sizes. At the species level, the simulations show that small and large species dominate the community successively (small species being more abundant at small sizes and large species being more abundant at large sizes) and that the total biomass of a species decreases with its maximal size which again corroborates empirical studies. Our results indicate that the simultaneous consideration of individual growth and reproduction, size-structured trophic interactions, the diversity of life-history traits and a density-dependent stabilizing process allow realistic community structure and dynamics to emerge without any arbitrary prescription. As a logical consequence of our model construction and a basis for future studies, we define the function {$\Phi$} as the relative contribution of each species to the total biomass of the ecosystem, for any given size. We argue that this function is a measure of the functional role of biodiversity characterizing the impact of the structure of the community (its species composition) on its function (the relative proportions of losses, dissipation and biological work).},

  abstract = {Skip to Next Section Intertidal fish species face gradual chronic changes in temperature and greater extremes of acute thermal exposure through climate-induced warming. As sea temperatures rise, it has been proposed that whole-animal performance will be impaired through oxygen and capacity limited thermal tolerance [OCLTT; reduced aerobic metabolic scope (MS)] and, on acute exposure to high temperatures, thermal safety margins may be reduced because of constrained acclimation capacity of upper thermal limits. Using the New Zealand triplefin fish (Forsterygion lapillum), this study addressed how performance in terms of growth and metabolism (MS) and upper thermal tolerance limits would be affected by chronic exposure to elevated temperature. Growth was measured in fish acclimated (12 weeks) to present and predicted future temperatures and metabolic rates were then determined in fish at acclimation temperatures and with acute thermal ramping. In agreement with the OCLTT hypothesis, chronic exposure to elevated temperature significantly reduced growth performance and MS. However, despite the prospect of impaired growth performance under warmer future summertime conditions, an annual growth model revealed that elevated temperatures may only shift the timing of high growth potential and not the overall annual growth rate. While the upper thermal tolerance (i.e. critical thermal maxima) increased with exposure to warmer temperatures and was associated with depressed metabolic rates during acute thermal ramping, upper thermal tolerance did not differ between present and predicted future summertime temperatures. This suggests that warming may progressively decrease thermal safety margins for hardy generalist species and could limit the available habitat range of intertidal populations.},

  abstract = {Marine animals are disappearing, too The loss of animal species in terrestrial environments has been well documented and is continuing. Loss of species in marine environments has been slower than in terrestrial systems, but appears to be increasing rapidly. McCauley et al. review the recent patterns of species decline and loss in marine environments. Though they note many worrying declines, they also highlight approaches that might allow us to prevent the type of massive defaunation that has occurred on land. Science, this issue 10.1126/science.1255641 Structured Abstract BACKGROUND Comparing patterns of terrestrial and marine defaunation helps to place human impacts on marine fauna in context and to navigate toward recovery. Defauna\-tion began in earnest tens of thousands of years later in the oceans than it did on land. Although defaunation has been less severe in the oceans than on land, our effects on marine animals are increasing in pace and impact. Humans have caused few complete extinctions in the sea, but we are responsible for many ecological, commercial, and local extinctions. Despite our late start, humans have already powerfully changed virtually all major marine ecosystems. ADVANCES Humans have profoundly decreased the abundance of both large (e.g., whales) and small (e.g., anchovies) marine fauna. Such declines can generate waves of ecological change that travel both up and down ma\-rine food webs and can alter ocean ecosystem functioning. Human harvesters have also been a major force of evolutionary change in the oceans and have reshaped the genetic structure of marine animal populations. Climate change threatens to accelerate marine defaunation over the next century. The high mobility of many marine animals offers some increased, though limited, capacity for marine species to respond to climate stress, but it also exposes many species to increased risk from other stressors. Because humans are intensely reliant on ocean ecosystems for food and other ecosystem services, we are deeply affected by all of these forecasted changes. Three lessons emerge when comparing the marine and terrestrial defaunation experiences: (i) today's low rates of marine extinction may be the prelude to a major extinction pulse, similar to that observed on land during the industrial revolution, as the footprint of human ocean use widens; (ii) effectively slowing ocean defaunation requires both protected areas and careful management of the intervening ocean matrix; and (iii) the terrestrial experience and current trends in ocean use suggest that habitat destruction is likely to become an increasingly dominant threat to ocean wildlife over the next 150 years. OUTLOOK Wildlife populations in the oceans have been badly damaged by human activity. Nevertheless, marine fauna generally are in better condition than terrestrial fauna: Fewer marine animal extinctions have occurred; many geographic ranges have shrunk less; and numerous ocean ecosystems remain more wild than terrestrial ecosystems. Consequently, meaningful rehabilitation of affected marine animal populations remains within the reach of managers. Human dependency on marine wildlife and the linked fate of marine and terrestrial fauna necessitate that we act quickly to slow the advance of marine defaunation. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/347/6219/1255641/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Timeline (log scale) of marine and terrestrial defaunation. The marine defaunation experience is much less advanced, even though humans have been harvesting ocean wildlife for thousands of years. The recent industrialization of this harvest, however, initiated an era of intense marine wildlife declines. If left unmanaged, we predict that marine habitat alteration, along with climate change (colored bar: IPCC warming), will exacerbate marine defaunation. Marine defaunation, or human-caused animal loss in the oceans, emerged forcefully only hundreds of years ago, whereas terrestrial defaunation has been occurring far longer. Though humans have caused few global marine extinctions, we have profoundly affected marine wildlife, altering the functioning and provisioning of services in every ocean. Current ocean trends, coupled with terrestrial defaunation lessons, suggest that marine defaunation rates will rapidly intensify as human use of the oceans industrializes. Though protected areas are a powerful tool to harness ocean productivity, especially when designed with future climate in mind, additional management strategies will be required. Overall, habitat degradation is likely to intensify as a major driver of marine wildlife loss. Proactive intervention can avert a marine defaunation disaster of the magnitude observed on land.},

However, ignoring complex underlying spatial patterns can lead to increased risk of failures in management. Utilizing geostatistical approaches in conjunction with a traditional fishery biomass dynamics model, we develop a spatially-explicit modelling framework that treats the underlying population dynamics as spatial processes. Simulation experiments demonstrate that this approach reliably estimates variance parameters and accurately captures true patterns of population change. We further demonstrate the utility of our modelling framework in a real setting using data from the Canadian Maritimes Inshore Scallop Fishery. The model captures time-varying spatial patterns in both population characteristics and fishing pressure without explicit knowledge of the underlying mechanisms and retains the ability to scale up to the whole spatial domain with less associated uncertainty than for temporal models. These results lead to improved scientific advice for management, future-proofing of the assessment to shifts in stock productivity and fishing effort, and provide information that can be used to develop more effective management approaches.},

  abstract = {Factors constraining the structure of food webs can be investigated by comparing classes of ecosystems. We find that pelagic ecosystems, those based on one-celled primary producers, have longer food chains than terrestrial ecosystems. Yet pelagic ecosystems have lower primary productivity, contrary to the hypothesis that greater energy flows permit higher trophic levels. We hypothesize that longer food chain length in pelagic ecosystems, compared with terrestrial ecosystems, is associated with smaller pelagic animal body size permitting more rapid trophic energy transfer. Assuming negative allometric dependence of biomass production rate on body mass at each trophic level, the lowest three pelagic animal trophic levels are estimated to add biomass more rapidly than their terrestrial counterparts by factors of 12, 4.8, and 2.6. Pelagic animals consequently transport primary production to a fifth trophic level 50\textendash 190 times more rapidly than animals in terrestrial webs. This difference overcomes the approximately fivefold slower pelagic basal productivity, energetically explaining longer pelagic food chains. In addition, ectotherms, dominant at lower pelagic animal trophic levels, have high metabolic efficiency, also favoring higher rates of trophic energy transfer in pelagic ecosystems. These two animal trophic flow mechanisms imply longer pelagic food chains, reestablishing an important role for energetics in food web structure.},

The fitnesses of individuals change with their ecological context, and so the form and strength of selective agents change with abiotic factors and the phenotypes and abundances of interacting species. I use standard models of consumer-resource interactions to explore the ecological dynamics of natural selection and how various trait types influence these dynamics and the resulting structure of a community of coevolving species. Evolutionary optima favored by natural selection depend critically on the abundances of interacting species, and the traits of species can undergo dynamic cycling in limited areas of parameter space. The ecological dynamics of natural selection can also drive shifts from one adaptive peak to another, and these ecologically driven adaptive peak shifts are fundamental to the dynamics of niche differentiation. Moreover, this ecological differentiation is fostered in more productive and more benign environments where species interactions are stronger and where the selection gradients generated by species interactions are stronger. Finally, community structure resulting from coevolution depends fundamentally on the types of traits that underlie species interactions. The ecological dynamics of the process cannot be simplified, neglected, or ignored if we are to build a predictive theory of natural selection.},

  abstract = {The density of organisms declines with size, because larger organisms need more energy than smaller ones and energetic losses occur when larger organisms feed on smaller ones. A potential expression of density-size distributions are Normalized Biomass Size Spectra (NBSS), which plot the logarithm of biomass independent of taxonomy within bins of logarithmic organismal size, divided by the bin width. Theoretically, the NBSS slope of multi-trophic communities is exactly \`A1.0 if the trophic transfer efficiency (TTE, ratio of production rates between adjacent trophic levels) is 10\% and the predator-prey mass ratio (PPMR) is fixed at 104. Here we provide evidence from four multi-trophic lake food webs that empirically estimated TTEs correspond to empirically estimated slopes of the respective community NBSS. Each of the NBSS considered pelagic and benthic organisms spanning size ranges from bacteria to fish, all sampled over three seasons in 1 yr. The four NBSS slopes were significantly steeper than \`A1.0 (range \`A1.14 to \`A1.19, with 95\% CIs excluding \`A1). The corresponding average TTEs were substantially lower than 10\% in each of the four food webs (range 1.0\% to 3.6\%, mean 1.85\%). The overall slope merging all biomass-size data pairs from the four systems (\`A1.17) was almost identical to the slope predicted from the arithmetic mean TTE of the four food webs (\`A1.18) assuming a constant PPMR of 104. Accordingly, our empirical data confirm the theoretically predicted quantitative relationship between TTE and the slope of the biomass-size distribution. Furthermore, we show that benthic and pelagic organisms can be merged into a community NBSS, but future studies have yet to explore potential differences in habitat-specific TTEs and PPMRs. We suggest that community NBSS may provide valuable information on the structure of food webs and their energetic pathways, and can result in improved accuracy of TTE-estimates.},

The Baltic Sea in northern Europe has one of the largest anthropogenically induced oxygen-deficient bottom zones in the world. Despite the decrease of nutrient supply after the 1980s, recently observed oxygen consumption rates are higher than ever observed, limiting the impact of natural ventilation by oxygen-enriched saltwater intrusions. We have estimated oxygen consumption rates after saltwater inflows during subsequent stagnation periods from monitoring observations and model results for 1850\textendash 2015. In recent years, ventilating water that originates mainly from the surface layer has contained higher concentrations of organic matter, zooplankton, and higher trophic levels. As a result, oxygen consumption in the water column has increased relatively more than oxygen consumption in the sediment, primarily due to respiration of zooplankton and higher trophic levels. Subsequently, natural ventilation has become less effective in alleviating hypoxia, instead amplifying deoxygenation of the deep water. We propose that such a detrimental, positive feedback may also affect other coastal seas with nutrient excess and with an intense, internal recirculation. Other drivers of oxygen consumption, like warming, were found to be less important under contemporary conditions.},

  abstract = {Small pelagic fish have shown a general decrease in size and body condition over the past two decades in several European regional seas. Although the underlying processes are still not well understood, recent studies point to a bottom-up control. In order to better understand how the environment impacts the main individual life history traits, which themselves control the dynamic of the population, we developed a comparative approach between two species, European anchovy and sardine, and across three regions of the Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea: the English Channel in the north, to the Bay of Biscay and the Gulf of Lion in the south. We developed a bioenergetic modeling framework based on the Dynamic Energy Budget theory (DEB). Our DEB models were forced using two different representations of the lower trophic levels, POLCOMS-ERSEM and SEAPODYM models. Our models were calibrated for the Bay of Biscay and then projected on to the other regions, over the early 2000s (period with bigger fish) and the early 2010s (period with smaller fish). The environment alone, temperature and zooplankton, explained a significant part of the observed regional differences in growth. However, the temporal trends simulated by the lower trophic levels models, when transcribed through bioenergetics, could not explain the strong decrease in length and weight that occurred in the Bay of Biscay (-30~\% in weight for anchovy and -20~\% for sardine) and in the Gulf of Lion (-30~\% for anchovy and -50~\% for sardine). Through a scenario approach, we estimated that a decrease in zooplankton quality could be a significant driver of the observed decrease in size both in the Bay of Biscay and in the Gulf of Lion (decrease in assimilable energy of 4 to 5~\% and 15 to 17~\% in the Bay of Biscay and the Gulf of Lion, respectively). For such a decrease in size, a zooplankton biomass of the same quality should have been reduced by between 17 and 31~\% in the Bay of Biscay over a 10- to 15-year period, while no biologically realistic estimations were obtained for the Gulf of Lion. The validity of these proposed changes in biomass and quality is discussed in context of alternative explanations.},

The high permanent swimming activities also indicated that the concept of standard metabolism may not be meaningful in schooling planktivorous fish. These results suggest that generally in bioenergetic models for clupeid schooling fish the activity multipliers should be chosen very conservatively.},

  abstract = {The first American Naturalist appeared in March 1867. In a countdown to the 150th anniversary, the editors have solicited short commentaries on articles from the past that deserve a second look. When I started my PhD in 2000, I was a part of a cohort of graduate students delighted with the prospect that evolu-tionary biology could be used to predict and explain pat-terns of traits observed in nature. We were surrounded by a wealth of wonderful theory at varying levels of abstraction from reality, and our goal was to apply this theory to data from the specific systems that we studied. Making predictions about traits in evolutionary biology invariably involves discussions of trade-offs. Everything eventually comes back to survival and fertility, and if there is nothing to hold back survival (or fertility), you can pre-dict nothing more interesting than that survival (or fertil-ity) should be maximized. Consequently, almost every grad-uate student in my cohort was looking for a trade-off. Not one of us could find one. It was frustrating; we thought Dar-winian demons were unlikely. We knew that, somewhere, allocation decisions must have a cost; but in systems rang-ing from birds to plants, none of us had any success in quan-tifying anything that looked like one fitness component go-ing up while another came down. In my system, plants that grew better also survived better and often produced more seeds. And then one of us stumbled across van Noordwijk and de Jong's 1986 paper in The American Naturalist. There are many reasons to treasure this paper\textemdash for example, it con-tains my favorite definition of life-history theory: " an elab-orate answer to the simple question of why having more off-spring is not always selected for " (p. 137)\textemdash but it also contains a possible solution to the problem that my cohort had been wrestling with. Van Noordwijk and de Jong bring up what they refer to as the " trivial but very real " fact that there is heterogeneity across individuals: some individuals have access to more resources than others do. This might result from luck alone, but the authors suggest that it could also be genetically based. Using an elegantly simple model, they demonstrate why this fact might conceal trade-offs.

Projections of population dynamics made in the absence of such fluctuations may consequently be misleading. However, data for estimation of yearly fluctuations in demographic parameters are often limited. Accordingly, the current diverse range of statistical and demographic modelling strategies used for stochastic population modelling may influence predictions. * We used simulations to explore the effects of different methods of parameter estimation on projections of population dynamics obtained using stochastic integral projection models (IPMs). The simulations were built from data on a monocarpic thistle, Carlina vulgaris, and an ungulate, Soay sheep, Ovis aries; these populations are subject to yearly fluctuation in vital rates facilitating the exploration of the effects of different methods of model construction on the properties of stochastic IPMs. Specifically, we looked at effects on the stochastic growth rate, log {$\lambda$}s, and the mean and variance in the one-step population growth rate (Nt+1/Nt). * Our analyses showed that none of the tested approaches resulted in large biases in the estimation of log {$\lambda$}s. However, when realistic study durations (e.g. 12 years) were used for statistical modelling, the confidence intervals around the {$\lambda$}s estimates remained large. Estimation of the variance in one-step population growth rates, on the other hand, was strongly sensitive to the method employed, and the overestimation and underestimation of the variance were also influenced by the life history of the organism. * Our findings highlight the need to consider the influences of statistical and demographic modelling approaches when population dynamics have significant temporal stochasticity, as in population viability analyses and evolutionary predictions of bet hedging.},

  abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change has resulted in warming temperatures and reduced oxygen concentrations in the global oceans. Much remains unknown on the impacts of reduced oxygen concentrations on the biology and distribution of marine fishes. In the Southern California Channel Islands, visual fish surveys were conducted frequently in a manned submersible at three rocky reefs between 1995 and 2009. This area is characterized by a steep bathymetric gradient, with the surveyed sites Anacapa Passage, Footprint and Piggy Bank corresponding to depths near 50, 150 and 300 m. Poisson models were developed for each fish species observed consistently in this network of rocky reefs to determine the impact of depth and year on fish peak distribution. The interaction of depth and year was significant in 23 fish types, with 19 of the modelled peak distributions shifting to a shallower depth over the surveyed time period. Across the 23 fish types, the peak distribution shoaled at an average rate of 8.7 m of vertical depth per decade. Many of the species included in the study, including California sheephead, copper rockfish and blue rockfish, are targeted by commercial and recreational fisheries. CalCOFI hydrographic samples are used to demonstrate significant declines in dissolved oxygen at stations near the survey sites which are forced by a combination of natural multidecadal oscillations and anthropogenic climate change. This study demonstrates in situ fish depth distribution shifts over a 15-year period concurrent with oxygen decline. Climate-driven distribution shifts in response to deoxygenation have important implications for fisheries management, including habitat reduction, habitat compression, novel trophic dynamics and reduced body condition. Continued efforts to predict the formation and severity of hypoxic zones and their impact on fisheries dynamics will be essential to guiding effective placement of protected areas and fisheries regulations.},

  abstract = {The slowing of growth as fish age has long been believed to be related to energy expenditure for maturation, and this rationalization has been used to explain why, across nearly all fish species, the relationship between size at first maturity (Lm) and maximum (Lmax) or asymptotic length (L{$\infty$}) is relatively constant. In contrast, the Gill-Oxygen Limitation Theory (GOLT) postulates that (1) fish growth slows because as they grow, their two dimensional ability to extract oxygen from the water diminishes relative to their three dimensional weight gain, and (2) they can only invest energy for maturation if oxygen supply at their size at first maturity (Qm) exceeds that needed for maintenance metabolism (Q{$\infty$}). It has been reported previously across dozens of marine fish species that the relationship between Qm vs. Q{$\infty$} is linear and further, it can be mathematically converted to Lm vs. L{$\infty$} by raising both terms to the power of D (the gill surface factor), resulting in a slope of 1.36. If the GOLT is universal, a similar slope should exist for LmD vs. L{$\infty$}D relationships for freshwater species across multiple individual populations that reside in disparate habitats, although to our knowledge this has never been evaluated. For analysis, we used existing data from previous studies conducted on 51 stream-dwelling populations of redband trout Oncorhynchus mykiss gairdneri, Yellowstone cutthroat trout O. clarkii bouvieri, and mountain whitefish Prosopium williamsoni. Resulting LmD vs. L{$\infty$}D slopes combining all data points (1.35) or for all species considered separately (range = 1.29\textendash 1.40) were indeed equivalent to the slope originally produced for the marine species from which the GOLT-derived relationship was first reported. We briefly discuss select papers both supporting and resisting various aspects of the GOLT, note that it could potentially explain shrinking sizes of marine fish, and call for more concerted research efforts combining laboratory and field expertise in fish growth research.

Specific respiration rates (R in g O2 g-1 d-1) declined as a power function of body mass and increased exponentially with temperature and was expressed as: R = 0.0007 * W -0.31 * e 0.13 * T. The ability of this model to predict specific respiration rate was evaluated by comparing observed values with those predicted by the model. Our findings suggest that the respiration rate of G. maculatus is the result of multiple interactive processes (intrinsic and extrinsic factors) that modulate each other in `metamechanistic' ways; this would help to explain the species' ability to undergo the complex ontogenetic habitat shifts observed in the lakes of the Andean Patagonic range.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study was to provide a database of the incipient lethal concentrations for reduced dissolved oxygen (DO) for selected marine and estuarine species including 12 species of fish, 9 crustaceans, and 1 bivalve. All species occur in the Virginian Province, USA, which is a cold temperate region. The study period was August 1987 to September 1995. Standard bioassay procedures were employed, with most tests being of 4-day duration. Up to eight lethal concentrations (LCs) between LC05 and LC95 were estimated. The study provides four general conclusions about determining lethal thresholds of low DO for these organisms. First, the concentration response curve of most species did not change greatly beyond day~1 of the exposure with the exception of crustacean larvae, which were usually more sensitive on day~4, possibly due to molting. Second, acute LC50 values (1- to 4-day) for low DO were influenced by life-stage and habitat, with pelagic larvae generally being the most sensitive and benthic juveniles the least. Species mean LC50 values ranged from 1.4 to 3.3~mg l\textendash 1 for larvae, 1.0 to 2.2~mg l\textendash 1 for postlarvae, and 0.5 to 1.6~mg l\textendash 1 for juveniles. No intraspecific differences in LC50 were detected between larval stages in crustaceans or with age in larval fishes. The response range between LC05 and LC95 was narrowest for the least sensitive organisms (0.6~mg l\textendash 1), and broadened with sensitivity. The mean LC10:LC50 ratio for all species was 1.32 for larvae and juveniles, and 1.36 for postlarvae. The ratio for postlarvae represents only four species, and hence is not considered different from the other life stages. Third, variability increased with increased species and life stage sensitivity to low DO, and with endpoints of LC15 and below, which reduces the certainty of some of these results. Lastly, no influence of temperatures between 20\textdegree C and 30\textdegree C was detected in a small set of tests with thermally acclimated crustacean larvae. This data set has been used to describe protection limits for juvenile and adult survival, and for larval recruitment for the case of persistent ({$\geq$}24~h) low DO for estuarine and coastal waters of the Virginian Province, USA.},

A key assumption of this conceptualization is that all individuals inside a box are functionally equivalent.

Synthesizing recent studies, we show that stage structure can modify the dynamics of consumer-resource communities owing to stage-related shifts in the nature and strength of interactions that occur within and between populations. As a consequence, stage structure can stabilize consumer-resource dynamics, create possibilities for alternative community states, modify conditions for coexistence of competitors, and alter the strength and direction of trophic cascades. Consideration of stage structure can thus lead to outcomes that are not expected based on unstructured approaches. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Here, we examine several well-known ecogeographical rules, especially those pertaining to body size in contemporary, historical and fossil taxa.

These rules hold at various time scales, ranging from contemporary to geological time scales. Patterns of body size variation in response to climate change at the individual species level may also be detected at the community level. The patterns underlying ecotypic variation are complex and highly context-dependent, reducing the 'predictive-power' of ecogeographical rules. This is especially true when considering the increasing impact of human activities on the environment. Nonetheless, ecogeographical rules may help interpret the likely influences of anthropogenic climate change on ecosystems. Global climate change has already influenced the body size of several contemporary species, and will likely have an even greater impact on animal communities in the future.

The deep sea provides a natural environmental gradient within which to study changes in different diversity metrics, but traits of deep-sea fish are not widely known, hampering the application of functional diversity to this globally important system. We used morphological traits to determine the functional richness and functional divergence of demersal fish assemblages along the continental slope in the Northeast Atlantic, at depths of 300\textendash 2,000 m. We compared these metrics to size diversity based on individual body size and species richness. Functional richness and size diversity showed similar patterns, with the highest diversity at intermediate depths; functional divergence showed the opposite pattern, with the highest values at the shallowest and deepest parts of the study site. Species richness increased with depth. The functional implications of these patterns were deduced by examining depth-related changes in morphological traits and the dominance of feeding guilds as illustrated by stable isotope analyses. The patterns in diversity and the variation in certain morphological traits can potentially be explained by changes in the relative dominance of pelagic and benthic feeding guilds. All measures of diversity examined here suggest that the deep areas of the continental slope may be equally or more diverse than assemblages just beyond the continental shelf.\textbackslash textless/p\textbackslash textgreater},

Tagging data provide valuable information about fish growth, and are especially useful when age-based growth estimates and stock assessments are compromised by age-determination uncertainties. However, in the literature there is a lack of studies assessing possible changes in growth over time using tagging data. Here, data from tagging experiments performed in the Baltic Sea between 1971 and 2019 were added to those previously analysed for 1955\textendash 1970 to build the most extensive tagging dataset available for Eastern Baltic cod (Gadus morhua, Gadidae), a threatened stock with severe age-determination problems. Two length-based methods, the GROTAG model (based on the von Bertalanffy growth function) and a Generalized Additive Model, were used to assess for the first time the potential long-term changes in cod growth using age-independent data. Both methods showed strong changes in growth with an increase until the end of the 1980s (8.6\textendash 10.6 cm/year for a 40 cm cod depending on the model) followed by a sharp decline. This study also revealed that the current growth of cod is the lowest observed in the past 7 decades (4.3\textendash 5.1 cm/year for a 40 cm cod depending on the model), indicating very low productivity. This study provides the first example of the use of tagging data to estimate multidecadal changes in growth rates in wild fish.

The Eastern Baltic cod               Gadus morhua               , one of the most commercially and ecologically important stocks in the Baltic Sea, is currently one of the most severely impacted fish stocks in Europe. During the last 2 decades, this stock has experienced drastic decreases in population size, distributional range, individual growth and body condition, all of which may have affected the movements between different areas of the Baltic Sea. In this study, we investigated the seasonal movement patterns of Eastern Baltic cod by re-analysing historical tagging data collected by the countries surrounding the Baltic Sea (1955-1988) and compared historical patterns with contemporary data from a recent international tagging experiment (2016-2019). Our re-analyses of historical data showed the presence of different movement behaviours, i.e. resident or seasonally migratory, with larger distances moved by cod released in the northern and central Baltic areas compared to cod released in the southern Baltic areas. Furthermore, trends from the recent tagging experiment indicate a persistent resident strategy in the southern Baltic area. These findings present additional information on general movement patterns and area utilisation of Eastern Baltic cod that could inform future management actions and aid stock recovery.},

The copepod serves as a major food organism for larval as well as for adult, pelagic planktivorous fish. Large interannual fluctuations in the standing stock of P. elongatus have been attributed to significant changes in the hydrographic environment over the last two decades. In particular, the decreasing salinity in the Baltic deep basins, a result of a change in atmospheric forcing leading to an increase in rainfall since the 1980s and of a lack of pulses of saline water intrusions from the North Sea, was found to affect reproduction and maturation of the copepod. In parallel, dramatic changes in the weight-at-age of herring, one of the most important commercial fishes of the Baltic Sea, have been observed since the late 1980s. Using time-series on herring stomach contents, as well as length and weight, we provide evidence for a chain of events relating variability in climate, salinity and P. elongatus abundance to changes in diet and condition of herring in the Central Baltic Sea.},

  abstract = {Marine ecosystems such as the Baltic Sea are currently under strong atmospheric and anthropogenic pressure. Besides natural and human-induced changes in climate, major anthropogenic drivers such as overfishing and anthropogenic eutrophication are significantly affecting ecosystem structure and function. Recently, studies demonstrated the existence of alternative stable states in various terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. These so-called ecosystem regime shifts have been explained mainly as a result of multiple causes, e.g. climatic regime shifts, overexploitation or a combination of both. The occurrence of ecosystem regime shifts has important management implications, as they can cause significant losses of ecological and economic resources. Because of hysteresis in ecosystem responses, restoring regimes considered as favourable may require drastic and expensive management actions. Also the Baltic Sea, the largest brackish water body in the world ocean, and its ecosystems are strongly affected by atmospheric and anthropogenic drivers. Here, we present results of an analysis of the state and development of the Central Baltic Sea ecosystem integrating hydroclimatic, nutrient, phyto- and zooplankton as well as fisheries data. Our analyses of 52 biotic and abiotic variables using multivariate statistics demonstrated a major reorganization of the ecosystem and identified two stable states between 1974 and 2005, separated by a transition period in 1988\textendash 1993. We show the change in Baltic ecosystem structure to have the characteristics of a discontinuous regime shift, initiated by climate-induced changes in the abiotic environment and stabilized by fisheries-induced feedback loops in the food web. Our results indicate the importance of maintaining the resilience of an ecosystem to atmospherically induced environmental change by reducing the anthropogenic impact.},

  abstract = {The European flounder Platichthys flesus (Linnaeus, 1758) displays two contrasting reproductive behaviors in the Baltic Sea: offshore spawning of pelagic eggs and coastal spawning of demersal eggs, a behavior observed exclusively in the Baltic Sea. Previous studies showed marked differences in behavioral, physiological, and life-history traits of flounders with pelagic and demersal eggs. Furthermore, a recent study demonstrated that flounders with pelagic and demersal eggs represent two reproductively isolated, parapatric species arising from two distinct colonization events from the same ancestral population. Using morphological data we first established that the syntypes on which the original description of P. flesus was based belong to the pelagic-spawning lineage. We then used a combination of morphological and physiological characters as well as genome-wide genetic data to describe flounders with demersal eggs as a new species: Platichthys solemdali sp. nov. The new species can be clearly distinguished from P. flesus based on egg morphology, egg and sperm physiology as well as via population genetic and phylogenetic analyses. While the two species do show some minor morphological differences in the number of anal and dorsal fin rays, no external morphological feature can be used to unambiguously identify individuals to species. Therefore, we developed a simple molecular diagnostic test able to unambiguously distinguish P. solemdali from P. flesus with a single PCR reaction, a tool that should be useful to fishery scientists and managers, as well as to ecologists studying these species.},

For example, indices for many semi-pelagic species rely on acoustic and bottom trawl gear that differ in water column coverage, and so spatiotemporal trends in fish vertical distribution affect the availability of fish to each gear type. The gears together cover the whole water column, and so in principle allow estimation of more accurate, combined indices of the whole population. Here, we extend previous methods and develop a vertically integrated index, which accounts for spatiotemporal correlation and works with data unbalanced spatially or unpaired from distinct surveys. Using eastern Bering Sea walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) as an example, we identified clear spatial and temporal patterns in vertical distribution and gear availability from 2007 to 2018. Estimated acoustic annual vertical availability ranged from 0.339 to 0.888 among years, and from 0.588 to 0.911 for the bottom trawl survey. Our results highlight the importance of accounting for the spatiotemporal and vertical distribution of semi-pelagic fish to estimate more accurate indices, and provide important context for gear availability.},

The statistical software platforms AD Model Builder (ADMB) and Template Model Builder (TMB) are particularly popular in the ecological literature, where they are typically used to perform frequentist inference of complex models. However, both lack capabilities for flexible and efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) integration. Recently, the no-U-turn sampler (NUTS) MCMC algorithm has gained popularity for Bayesian inference through the software Stan because it is efficient for high dimensional, complex hierarchical models. Here, we introduce the R packages adnuts and tmbstan, which provide NUTS sampling in parallel and interactive diagnostics with ShinyStan. The ADMB source code was modified to provide NUTS, while TMB models are linked directly into Stan. We describe the packages, provide case studies demonstrating their use, and contrast performance against Stan. For TMB models, we show how to test the accuracy of the Laplace approximation using NUTS. For complex models, the performance of ADMB and TMB was typically within +/- 50\% the speed of Stan. In one TMB case study we found inaccuracies in the Laplace approximation, potentially leading to biased inference. adnuts provides a new method for estimating hierarchical ADMB models which previously were infeasible. TMB users can fit the same model in both frequentist and Bayesian paradigms, including using NUTS to test the validity of the Laplace approximation of the marginal likelihood for arbitrary subsets of parameters. These software developments extend the available statistical methods of the ADMB and TMB user base with no additional effort by the user.},

Our results show that temperature alone was able to explain 73\% of the variance in the relative contribution of small cells to total phytoplankton biomass regardless of differences in trophic status or inorganic nutrient loading. Our analysis predicts a gradual shift toward smaller primary producers in a warmer ocean.

However, predicting the number of recruits produced by a population has proven to be a difficult challenge. This may in part be a result of poor estimation of reproductive potential (RP). We determined if including increased information on reproductive biology in indices of RP results in better predictions of recruitment. We investigated some of the conditions that lead to better (or worse) recruitment prediction when more biologically complex indices of RP are used. Data from four populations in the Northwest Atlantic were examined: southern Grand Bank (NAFO Division 3NO) cod (Gadus morhua), Flemish Cap (NAFO Division 3M) cod, Newfoundland (NAFO Division 3LNO) American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides), and Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) (NAFO Subarea 2~+ Division 3KLMNO). Stock\textendash recruit models paired with complex indices of RP gave a better estimate of recruitment in slightly more than half of the tests conducted. When there were larger trends in the reproductive biology (maturity at age, sex ratio and egg production), more complex indices of RP were more likely to provide a better estimate of recruitment.},

The study period included both the warmest and coldest environmental conditions in the area over the past 60 yr. Temperature did not influence growth in length or weight, perhaps because growth at higher temperatures was limited by prey availability. Temperature significantly influenced both gutted body condition and liver condition (observed weight divided by predicted weight at length), but the effect was not consistent between the 2 measures of condition. Gutted body condition was highest at warm temperatures, whereas liver condition was highest at low temperatures. Measures of reproductive investment showed clear temperature effects. Fish matured earlier at both low and high temperatures than at intermediate temperatures. Fecundity of southern Grand Bank cod was highest at low temperatures, while the gonadosomatic index (GSI) was highest at warm temperatures. The lack of correlation with fecundity indicates that GSI may not be a good metric of reproductive investment but may be an indicator of how close fish are to spawning. The lower maturity and fecundity at intermediate temperatures could indicate a decrease in reproductive potential under these environmental conditions. Temperature throughout the entire year influenced fish condition, but only temperature during October to May affected reproductive investment. Most of the metrics were highly correlated between males and females, suggesting that both sexes make similar decisions about energy allocation over the observed temperature range.},

  abstract = {Fishing and climate change are profoundly impacting marine biota through unnatural selection and exposure to potentially stressful environmental conditions. Their effects, however, are often considered in isolation, and then only at the population level, despite there being great potential for synergistic selection on the individual. We explored how fishing and climate variability interact to affect an important driver of fishery productivity and population dynamics: individual growth rate. We projected that average growth rate would increase as waters warm, a harvest-induced release from density dependence would promote adult growth, and that fishing would increase the sensitivity of somatic growth to temperature. We measured growth increments from the otoliths of 400 purple wrasse (Notolabrius funicola), a site-attached temperate marine reef fish inhabiting an ocean warming hotspot. These were used to generate nearly two decades of annually resolved growth estimates from three populations spanning a period before and after the onset of commercial fishing. We used hierarchical models to partition variation in growth within and between individuals and populations, and attribute it to intrinsic (age, individual-specific) and extrinsic (local and regional climate, fishing) drivers. At the population scale, we detected predictable additive increases in average growth rate associated with warming and a release from density dependence. A fishing\textendash warming synergy only became apparent at the individual scale where harvest resulted in the 50\% reduction of thermal growth reaction norm diversity. This phenotypic change was primarily caused by the loss of larger individuals that showed a strong positive response to temperature change after the onset of size-selective harvesting. We speculate that the dramatic loss of individual-level biocomplexity is caused by either inadvertent fisheries selectivity based on behaviour, or the disruption of social hierarchies resulting from the selective harvesting of large, dominant and resource-rich individuals. Whatever the cause, the removal of individuals that display a positive growth response to temperature could substantially reduce species' capacity to adapt to climate change at temperatures well below those previously thought stressful.},

  abstract = {Growth is a fundamental biological process, driven by a multitude of intrinsic (within-individual) and extrinsic (environmental) factors, that underpins individual fitness and population demographics. Focusing on the comprehensive information stored in aquatic and terrestrial organism hard parts, we develop a series of increasingly complex hierarchical models to explore spatial and temporal sources of growth variation, ranging in resolution from within individuals to across a species. We apply this modeling framework to an extensive data set of otolith increment measurements from tiger flathead (Platycephalus richardsoni), a demersal commercially exploited fish that inhabits the warming waters of southeast Australia. We recreated growth histories (biochronology) up to four decades in length from seven fishing areas spanning this species' range. The dominant pattern in annual growth was an age-dependent, allometric decline that varied among individuals, sexes, fishing areas, years, and cohorts. We found evidence for among-area differences in growth-rate selectivity, whereby younger fish at capture were generally faster growers. Temporal growth variation was partitioned into two main sources: extrinsic year to year annual fluctuations in environmental conditions and persistent cohort-specific growth differences, reflecting density dependence and/or juvenile experience. Despite low levels of among-individual growth synchrony within areas, we detected a regionally coherent signal of increasing average growth rate through time, a trend related to oceanic warming. At the southerly (poleward) range limit, growth was only weakly related to temperature, but farther north in warmer waters this relationship strengthened until closer to the species' equatorward range limit, growth declined with increasing temperatures. We partitioned these species-wide and area-specific phenotypic responses into within- and among-individual components using a reaction norm approach. Individual tiger flathead likely possess sufficient growth plasticity to successfully adapt to warming waters across much of their range, but increased future warming in the north will continue to depress growth, affecting individual fitness and even population persistence. Our modeling framework is directly applicable to other long-term, individual-based, data sets such as those derived from tree rings, corals, and tag\textendash recapture studies, and provides an unprecedented level of resolution into the drivers of growth variation and the ecological and evolutionary implications of environmental and climatic change.},

Understanding the degree to which harvest-induced impacts increase the sensitivity of individuals, populations and ultimately species to environmental change is essential to ensuring sustainable fisheries management in a rapidly changing world. Here we generated multiple long-term (44\textendash 62 years), annually resolved, somatic growth chronologies of four commercially important fishes from New Zealand's coastal and shelf waters. We used these novel data to investigate how regional- and basin-scale environmental variability, in concert with fishing activity, affected individual somatic growth rates and the magnitude of spatial synchrony among stocks. Changes in somatic growth can affect individual fitness and a range of population and fishery metrics such as recruitment success, maturation schedules and stock biomass. Across all species, individual growth benefited from a fishing-induced release of density controls. For nearshore snapper and tarakihi, regional-scale wind and temperature also additively affected growth, indicating that future climate change-induced warming and potentially strengthened winds will initially promote the productivity of more poleward populations. Fishing increased the sensitivity of deep-water hoki and ling growth to the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO). A forecast shift to a positive IPO phase, in concert with current harvest strategies, will likely promote individual hoki and ling growth. At the species level, historical fishing practices and IPO synergized to strengthen spatial synchrony in average growth between stocks separated by 400\textendash 600 nm of ocean. Increased spatial synchrony can, however, increase the vulnerability of stocks to deleterious stochastic events. Together, our individual- and species-level results show how fishing and environmental factors can conflate to initially promote individual growth but then possibly heighten the sensitivity of stocks to environmental change.},

We show that the updated version of the model is internally consistent and is consistent with other predictions of metabolic scaling theory and empirical data. The OGM predicts not only the near universal sigmoidal form of growth curves but also the M(1/4) scaling of the characteristic times of ontogenetic stages in addition to the curvilinear decline in growth efficiency described by Brody. Additionally, the OGM relates the M(3/4) scaling across adults of different species to the scaling of metabolic rate across ontogeny within species. In providing a simple, quantitative description of how energy is allocated to growth, the OGM calls attention to unexplained variation, unanswered questions, and opportunities for future research.},

In these global relationships, the half-saturation constant Km, i.e. the resource availability at which half of the maximum intake is reached, determines the outcome of models and may contribute to explain behavioral traits, life-strategies and species occurrence. As macroecological data on this parameter are rather scarce, our investigation aims (1) to provide an overview of the half-saturation constants reported in literature and (2) to explore the consistency of the data with the body size trait. First, a meta-analysis was conducted on reviews and original studies published in literature. Second, the half-saturation constants obtained for several groups were linked to body size. In total, 338 half-saturation constants were collected from bacteria to ungulates, showing that the half-saturation reflects less than expected body size. Individual body size is not the dominant predictor determining the half-saturation constant, in contrast to interacting resource and consumer's sizes which are crucial to understand the variability of functional responses.},

Two unpublished data sets were examined, one from collapse-period trapping sites along the northeast coast of Newfoundland and one from a post-collapse inshore trawl survey. Cumulative surface and bottom temperatures were significant predictors of growth rates of the young fish with year-classes born during collapse experiencing slower growth than those born during subsequent warming. Relationships between accrued temperature and growth were consistent across periods, with slow growth of collapse-period fish reflecting slower accumulation of temperature-at-age. Temperature influences were spatially broad-based with no significant differences in growth rates for fish captured along the entire northeast coast of Newfoundland. Predicted differences in growth rates for collapse versus recovery year-classes were proportional to cumulative surface temperatures but not cumulative bottom temperatures. Although significant, temperature effects on growth were relatively unimportant at youngest ages. Overall, growth differences between periods were small but large differences occurred between slowest and fastest growing year-classes. The results suggest initial responses to increasing temperatures were delayed following collapse. We conclude that although temperature was an important determinant of dampened productivity that it alone cannot account for the collapse and slow recovery of the stock. This is the first known study to directly quantitatively link temperature impacts to an unfished component of the Northern cod stock complex during collapse, removing need for implicit assumptions about whether or not cold conditions contributed to the collapse of this iconic fish stock.},

We examined the evolutionary potential of thermal tolerance within a population of chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) by conducting a full-factorial breeding design and measuring the thermal performance of cardiac function and the critical thermal maximum (CTmax) of offspring from each family. Additive genetic variation in offspring phenotype was mostly negligible, although these direct genetic effects explained 53\% of the variation in resting heart rate (fH). Conversely, maternal effects had a significant influence on resting fH, scope for fH, cardiac arrhythmia temperature and CTmax. These maternal effects were associated with egg size, as indicated by strong relationships between the mean egg diameter of mothers and offspring thermal tolerance. Because egg size can be highly heritable in chinook salmon, our finding indicates that the maternal effects of egg size constitute an indirect genetic effect contributing to thermal tolerance. Such indirect genetic effects could accelerate evolutionary responses to the selection imposed by rising temperatures and could contribute to the population-specific thermal tolerance that has recently been uncovered among Pacific salmon populations.},

Derived from multiple ecosystems and latitudes, our metaanalysis of 632 published experiments quantified the direction and magnitude of ecological change resulting from ocean acidification and warming to conceptualize broadly based change. Primary production by temperate noncalcifying plankton increases with elevated temperature and CO2, whereas tropical plankton decreases productivity because of acidification. Temperature increases consumption by and metabolic rates of herbivores, but this response does not translate into greater secondary production, which instead decreases with acidification in calcifying and noncalcifying species. This effect creates a mismatch with carnivores whose metabolic and foraging costs increase with temperature. Species diversity and abundances of tropical as well as temperate species decline with acidification, with shifts favoring novel community compositions dominated by noncalcifiers and microorganisms. Both warming and acidification instigate reduced calcification in tropical and temperate reef-building species. Acidification leads to a decline in dimethylsulfide production by ocean plankton, which as a climate gas, contributes to cloud formation and maintenance of the Earth's heat budget. Analysis of responses in short- and long-term experiments and of studies at natural CO2 vents reveals little evidence of acclimation to acidification or temperature changes, except for microbes. This conceptualization of change across whole communities and their trophic linkages forecast a reduction in diversity and abundances of various key species that underpin current functioning of marine ecosystems.},

Most importantly, NHST does not provide us with two crucial pieces of information: (1) the magnitude of an effect of interest, and (2) the precision of the estimate of the magnitude of that effect. All biologists should be ultimately interested in biological importance, which may be assessed using the magnitude of an effect, but not its statistical significance. Therefore, we advocate presentation of measures of the magnitude of effects (i.e. effect size statistics) and their confidence intervals (CIs) in all biological journals. Combined use of an effect size and its CIs enables one to assess the relationships within data more effectively than the use of p values, regardless of statistical significance. In addition, routine presentation of effect sizes will encourage researchers to view their results in the context of previous research and facilitate the incorporation of results into future meta-analysis, which has been increasingly used as the standard method of quantitative review in biology. In this article, we extensively discuss two dimensionless (and thus standardised) classes of effect size statistics: d statistics (standardised mean difference) and r statistics (correlation coefficient), because these can be calculated from almost all study designs and also because their calculations are essential for meta-analysis. However, our focus on these standardised effect size statistics does not mean unstandardised effect size statistics (e.g. mean difference and regression coefficient) are less important. We provide potential solutions for four main technical problems researchers may encounter when calculating effect size and CIs: (1) when covariates exist, (2) when bias in estimating effect size is possible, (3) when data have non-normal error structure and/or variances, and (4) when data are non-independent. Although interpretations of effect sizes are often difficult, we provide some pointers to help researchers.

R2 has the extremely useful property of providing an absolute value for the goodness-of-fit of a model, which cannot be given by the information criteria. As a summary statistic that describes the amount of variance explained, R2 can also be a quantity of biological interest. One reason for the under-appreciation of R2 for mixed-effects models lies in the fact that R2 can be defined in a number of ways. Furthermore, most definitions of R2 for mixed-effects have theoretical problems (e.g. decreased or negative R2 values in larger models) and/or their use is hindered by practical difficulties (e.g. implementation). Here, we make a case for the importance of reporting R2 for mixed-effects models. We first provide the common definitions of R2 for LMs and GLMs and discuss the key problems associated with calculating R2 for mixed-effects models. We then recommend a general and simple method for calculating two types of R2 (marginal and conditional R2) for both LMMs and GLMMs, which are less susceptible to common problems. This method is illustrated by examples and can be widely employed by researchers in any fields of research, regardless of software packages used for fitting mixed-effects models. The proposed method has the potential to facilitate the presentation of R2 for a wide range of circumstances.},

  abstract = {How ectothermic animals will cope with global warming is a critical determinant of the ecological impacts of climate change. There has been extensive study of upper thermal tolerance limits among fish species but how intraspecific variation in tolerance may be affected by habitat characteristics and evolutionary history has not been considered. Intraspecific variation is a primary determinant of species vulnerability to climate change, with implications for global patterns of impacts of ongoing warming. Using published critical thermal maximum (CTmax) data on 203 fish species, we found that intraspecific variation in upper thermal tolerance varies according to a species' latitude and evolutionary history. Overall, tropical species show a lower intraspecific variation in thermal tolerance than temperate species. Notably, freshwater tropical species have a lower variation in tolerance than freshwater temperate species, which implies increased vulnerability to impacts of thermal stress. The extent of variation in CTmax among fish species has a strong phylogenetic signal, which may indicate a constraint on evolvability to rising temperatures in tropical fishes. That is, in addition to living closer to their upper thermal limits, tropical species may have higher sensitivity and lower adaptability to global warming compared to temperate counterparts. This is evidence that freshwater tropical fish communities, worldwide, are especially vulnerable to ongoing climate change.},

Of particular interest is the commercially important Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.), which has declined sharply in abundance in the North Sea over the past 20 years. Observations of the temperature experienced by 129 individual cod throughout the North Sea were made during a large-scale electronic tagging programme conducted between 1999 and 2005. We asked whether individual cod fully occupied the thermal habitat available to them. To this end, we compared the temperature experience of cod with independently measured contemporaneous sea-bottom temperature data. The majority of cod experienced a warmer fraction of the sea than was potentially available to them. By summer, most of the individuals in the south experienced temperatures considered superoptimal for growth. Cooler waters were within the reach of the cod and a small number of individuals migrated to areas that allowed them to experience lower temperatures, indicating that the cod had the capacity to find cooler water. Most did not, however, suggesting that the changing thermal regime of the North Sea is not yet causing adult cod to move to cooler waters.},

There are now six catch-curve methods available in the literature: the Chapman\textendash Robson, linear regression, weighted linear regression, Heincke, generalized Poisson linear, and random-intercept Poisson linear mixed model. An assumption shared among the underyling probability models of these estimators is that fish collected for ageing are sampled from the population by simple random sampling. This type of sampling is nearly impossible in fisheries research because populations are sampled in surveys that use gears that capture individuals in clusters and often fish for ageing are selected from multi-stage sampling. In this study, I explored the effects of multi-stage cluster sampling on the bias of the estimates of Z and their associated standard errors. I found that the generalized Poisson linear model and the Chapman\textendash Robson estimators were the least biased, whereas the random-intercept Poisson linear mixed model was the most biased under a wide range of simulation scenarios that included different levels of recruitment variation, intra-cluster correlation, sample sizes, and methods used to generate age frequencies. Standard errors of all estimators were under-estimated in almost all cases and should not be used in statistical comparisons.},

  abstract = {Accounting for energy use by fishes has been taking place for over 200 years. The original, and continuing gold standard for measuring energy use in terrestrial animals, is to account for the waste heat produced by all reactions of metabolism, a process referred to as direct calorimetry. Direct calorimetry is not easy or convenient in terrestrial animals and is extremely difficult in aquatic animals. Thus, the original and most subsequent measurements of metabolic activity in fishes have been measured via indirect calorimetry. Indirect calorimetry takes advantage of the fact that oxygen is consumed and carbon dioxide is produced during the catabolic conversion of foodstuffs or energy reserves to useful ATP energy. As measuring [CO2] in water is more challenging than measuring [O2], most indirect calorimetric studies on fishes have used the rate of O2 consumption. To relate measurements of O2 consumption back to actual energy usage requires knowledge of the substrate being oxidized. Many contemporary studies of O2 consumption by fishes do not attempt to relate this measurement back to actual energy usage. Thus, the rate of oxygen consumption (O2) has become a measurement in its own right that is not necessarily synonymous with metabolic rate. Because all extant fishes are obligate aerobes (many fishes engage in substantial net anaerobiosis, but all require oxygen to complete their life cycle), this discrepancy does not appear to be of great concern to the fish biology community, and reports of fish oxygen consumption, without being related to energy, have proliferated. Unfortunately, under some circumstances, these measures can be quite different from one another. A review of the methodological history of the two measurements and a look towards the future are included.},

We show a recent reversal in feeding level over body length. Present feeding levels of small cod indicate severe growth limitation and increased starvation-related mortality. For young cod, the low growth rate and the high mortality rate are manifested through a reduction in size-at-age. The low feeding levels are likely the result of a decrease in benthic prey abundance due to increased hypoxic areas, while decreasing abundances of pelagic species in the area of cod distribution have prevented a compensatory shift in diet. Our study emphasizes that environmental forcing and the decline in pelagic prey caused changes in consumption and growth rates of small cod. The food reduction is amplified by stunted growth leading to high densities of cod of smaller size competing for the scarce resources. The average growth rate is negative, and only individuals with feeding levels well above average will survive, though growing slowly. These results suggest that the relation between consumption rate, somatic growth and predatorprey population densities is strongly environmentally mediated.},

Multiple factors affecting growth and development in fish acted on this economically important stock over the same period including warming waters and an intensive fishery. Here, we employ North Sea cod as a model population, exploring how a physiologically relevant temperature metric (the growing degree-day, GDD; \textdegree C day) can be used to compare year-classes on a physiologically relevant time-scale, disentangling influences of climate (thermal history) on observed length-at-age trends. We conclude that the trends in North Sea cod length-at-age observed during the last three decades can be explained by a combination of temperature-dependent growth increases and a trend toward earlier maturation, the latter likely induced by the intensive fishing pressure, and possibly evidence of fisheries-induced evolution.},

However, diet-based biomass indices may be sensitive to underlying ecological dynamics between predators and prey, such as predator functional responses and changes in overlap in space and time. To evaluate these factors, we fit spatio-temporal models to stomach contents of five Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) predators and survey catch data for predators and Atlantic herring. We identified drivers of variation in stomach contents, evaluated spatial patterns in stomach content data, and produced predator-specific indices of seasonal Atlantic herring biomass. After controlling for spatio-temporal processes and predator length, diet-based indices of biomass shared similar decadal trends but varied substantially between predators and seasons on shorter time scales. Diet-based indices reflected prey biomass more than prey availability, but weak correlations indicated that not all biological processes were controlled for. Results provide potential guidance for developing diet-based biomass indices and contribute to a body of evidence demonstrating the utility of predator diet data to provide information about relative prey biomass.},

In this study, the horizontal and vertical distribution and density patterns of settled juvenile 0- and 1-group Baltic cod are determined, and their nursery areas are localised according to the environmental factors affecting them. Comparative statistical analyses of biological, hydrographic and hydroacoustic data are carried out based on standard ICES demersal trawl surveys and special integrated trawl and acoustic research surveys. Horizontal distribution maps for the 2001-2010 cohorts of juvenile cod are further generated by applying a statistical log-Gaussian Cox process model to the standard trawl survey data. The analyses indicate size-dependent horizontal and distinct vertical and diurnal distribution patterns related to the seabed topography, water layer depth, and the presence of hydrographic frontal zones (pycnoclines) as well as intraspecific patterns in relation to the presence of adult cod. The extent of the nursery areas also depends on the cod year class strength. Juvenile cod (\textbackslash textgreater/=3 cm) are present in all areas of the central Baltic Sea (CBS), showing broad dispersal. However, their highest density in the Baltic Basins is found at localities with a 40-70 m bottom depth in waters with oxygen concentrations above 2 ml O(2).l(-)(1) and temperatures above 5 degrees C. The smallest juveniles are also found in deep sea localities down to a 100 m depth and at oxygen concentrations between 2-4 ml O(2).l(-)(1). The vertical, diurnally stratified and repeated trawling and hydroacoustic target strength-depth distributions obtained from the special surveys show juvenile cod concentrations in frontal zone water layers (pycnocline). However, the analyses indicate that in the CBS, juvenile cod of all sizes do not appear to aggregate in dense schooling patterns, which differs from what has been reported from the North Sea.},

However, the prey size spectra found in Eastern Baltic cod stomachs reflect the low species diversity in the Baltic Sea. In general, Eastern Baltic cod feed on smaller prey in relation to their body size than other cod populations. Due to the truncated prey size distribution in the Baltic Sea, cod cannibalism functions as a compensatory mechanism that allows Baltic cod to reach their prey size potential. On the other hand, small- and intermediate-sized cod prey mainly on a few invertebrate prey species, potentially making them vulnerable to changes in these prey populations. Our results encourage further studies disentangling the relative effects of prey preference and prey availability on cod trophodynamics in species-poor systems such as the Baltic Sea.},

One approach attracting a lot of attention is generalized linear latent variable models (GLLVMs). However, software for fitting these models is typically slow and not practical for large datasets. The r package gllvm offers relatively fast methods to fit GLLVMs via maximum likelihood, along with tools for model checking, visualization and inference. The main advantage of the package over other implementations is speed, for example, being two orders of magnitude faster, and capable of handling thousands of response variables. These advances come from using variational approximations to simplify the likelihood expression to be maximized, automatic differentiation software for model-fitting (via the TMB package) and careful choice of initial values for parameters. Examples are used to illustrate the main features and functionality of the package, such as constrained or unconstrained ordination, including functional traits in `fourth corner' models, and (if the number of environmental coefficients is not large) make inferences about environmental associations.},

  abstract = {Dynamic energy budget (DEB) theory offers a perspective on population ecology whose starting point is energy utilization by, and homeostasis within, individual organisms. It is natural to ask what it adds to the existing large body of individual-based ecological theory. We approach this question pragmatically\textendash through detailed study of the individual physiology and population dynamics of the zooplankter Daphnia and its algal food. Standard DEB theory uses several state variables to characterize the state of an individual organism, thereby making the transition to population dynamics technically challenging, while ecologists demand maximally simple models that can be used in multi-scale modelling. We demonstrate that simpler representations of individual bioenergetics with a single state variable (size), and two life stages (juveniles and adults), contain sufficient detail on mass and energy budgets to yield good fits to data on growth, maturation and reproduction of individual Daphnia in response to food availability. The same simple representations of bioenergetics describe some features of Daphnia mortality, including enhanced mortality at low food that is not explicitly incorporated in the standard DEB model. Size-structured, population models incorporating this additional mortality component resolve some long-standing questions on stability and population cycles in Daphnia. We conclude that a bioenergetic model serving solely as a 'regression' connecting organismal performance to the history of its environment can rest on simpler representations than those of standard DEB. But there are associated costs with such pragmatism, notably loss of connection to theory describing interspecific variation in physiological rates. The latter is an important issue, as the type of detailed study reported here can only be performed for a handful of species.},

  abstract = {Two contrasting approaches are widely used to derive population dynamics as an emergent property deriving from the physiology and behavior of individual organisms. "Individual-based models" (IBMs) are computer simulations where the "state" (e.g., age, size) of each individual in a population is followed explicitly along with changes in its environment. Population properties (e.g., density, age- or size-structure) emerge from simple bookkeeping and descriptive statistics. Physiologically structured population models (PPSMs) have an identical philosophy, but assume a very large (formally infinite) population and that all individuals in a given state have an identical response to any given environment. These assumptions allow the bookkeeping to proceed through a series of mathematical steps that lead to partial differential or integral equations describing the population dynamics. There is software for both approaches that handles the bookkeeping, with the modeler specifying solely the individual model using stylized files, thereby eliminating the need for technical expertise in either complex computer simulations or advanced calculus. Each approach has its advantages and disadvantages. IBMs are easier to formulate and to explain to people with limited mathematical experience than PSPMs, but PSPMs allow for more extensive mapping of possible dynamic attractors. IBMs alone can reveal the population level effects of demographic stochasticity and of differences among individuals. Formal equilibrium analysis of PSPMs show possible stable states (size distributions) of the populations that include unstable steady states from which slightly perturbed populations may start cycling. The equilibrium size structure at these unstable states can serve as an initial condition for IBMs, thereby facilitating study of the cycles. We illustrated the interconnections and contrasting insights from the two approaches using a food-chain model for which the PSPM was previously studied by De Roos and Persson (Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA: 99, 12907-12912, 2002). Future general population ecology theory requires work with model populations that are both physiologically structured and distributed in space. We describe concepts from spatially explicit IBMs with identical individuals that, in combination with the results in this paper, may point to a way forward.},

  abstract = {How does warming affect maturation and reproductive investment in ectotherms? Younger age and smaller size at maturation, as well as altered reproduction processes, have been found in a few species subjected to elevated temperatures. These observations, however, come from studies that do not distinguish effects of warming on maturation from those on growth, are also restricted to single generation responses to warming, or have additional stressors besides warming in the study system. Here, we study warming effects on maturation and reproductive investment in wild, unexploited fish populations using a whole-ecosystem heating experiment. The experiment is conducted on Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis) in a heated and control area (with {$>$}5\textdegree C temperature difference) in the Baltic Sea. We compare female perch size at maturation using estimated probabilistic maturation reaction norms (PMRNs) and the gonado-somatic index over 17 years of heating, spanning approximately five to eight perch generations. Using the PMRN approach, we show that warming has substantial effects on maturation size independent of warming-induced changes in body growth. We found that young fish mature at a smaller size and invest more in developing their gonads in the heated population than in the unheated population. Our findings suggest that warming effects on reproductive investment may initially compensate for the cost of warming-induced decrease in maturation size caused by the trade-off between early maturation and size-dependent fecundity. After multiple additional generations of warming, maturation and reproduction traits in perch differed from those in the first generations following the onset of warming, which suggests that warming-induced evolution may have occurred. Our study is particularly relevant in the context of climate change because of the unusually large temperature difference between the areas and the fact that the heating occurred on an ecosystem level. We call for experimental studies resolving mechanisms of trait responses to warming across generations, complemented with genomic analyses, to aid understanding of organisms' long-term responses to climate change.},

This concept of oxygen- and capacity-limited thermal tolerance (OCLTT) is rapidly gaining popularity within climate change research and has been applied to several fish species. Here, we evaluated the relevance of aerobic performance of juvenile barramundi (Lates calcarifer) in the context of thermal preference and tolerance by (1) measuring standard and maximum metabolic rates (SMR and MMR, respectively) and AS of fish acclimated to 29 degrees C and acutely exposed to temperatures from 23 to 38 degrees C, (2) allowing the fish to behaviourally select a preferred temperature between 29 and 38 degrees C, and (3) quantifying alterations to AS after 5 weeks of acclimation to 29 and 38 degrees C. SMR and MMR both increased continuously with temperature in acutely exposed fish, but the increase was greater for MMR such that AS was highest at 38 degrees C, a temperature approaching the upper lethal limit (40-41 degrees C). Despite 38 degrees C eliciting maximum AS, when given the opportunity the fish selected a median temperature of 31.7 +/- 0.5 degrees C and spent only 10 +/- 3\% of their time at temperatures \textbackslash textgreater36 degrees C. Following acclimation to 38 degrees C, AS measured at 38 degrees C was decreased to the same level as 29 degrees C-acclimated fish measured at 29 degrees C, suggesting that AS may be dynamically modulated independent of temperature to accommodate the requirements of daily life. Together, these results reveal limited power of the OCLTT hypothesis in predicting optimal temperatures and effects of climate warming on juvenile barramundi.},

Different techniques exist for eliciting MMR of fishes, of which swim-flume respirometry (critical swimming speed tests and burst-swimming protocols) and exhaustive chases are the most common. Available data suggest that the most suitable method for eliciting MMR varies with species and ecotype, and depends on the propensity of the fish to sustain swimming for extended durations as well as its capacity to simultaneously exercise and digest food. MMR varies substantially (\textbackslash textgreater10 fold) between species with different lifestyles (i.e. interspecific variation), and to a lesser extent (\textbackslash textlessthree-fold) between individuals of the same species (i.e. intraspecific variation). MMR often changes allometrically with body size and is modulated by several environmental factors, including temperature and oxygen availability. Due to the significance of MMR in determining aerobic scope, interest in measuring this trait has spread across disciplines in attempts to predict effects of climate change on fish populations. Here, various techniques used to elicit and measure MMR in different fish species with contrasting lifestyles are outlined and the relevance of MMR to the ecology, fitness and climate change resilience of fishes is discussed.},

  abstract = {The power scaling of metabolic rate with body mass is fundamental to animal biology, due to the profound influence that animal size has on ecology and physiology. Yet the value of the scaling exponent (b) is highly debated. This scaling exponent has been suggested to be fixed at 0.67 or 0.75, or to vary systematically with cell size or metabolic intensity between the boundaries of 0.67 and 1. Despite this tremendous interest in the value of scaling exponents, little is known about metabolic scaling within individual animals and how this relates to population-level scaling. Here, we conducted a long-term study that repeatedly characterised the complete metabolic profile of a group of 68 individual fish (cunner, Tautogolabrus adspersus) by measuring their standard metabolic rate (SMR), routine metabolic rate (RMR), active metabolic rate (AMR) and aerobic scope (AS) in five separate trials over 10 months (fish mass range, 0.5\textendash 19.5 g). At all levels of metabolic intensity, the mean exponents for the group of fish at any single point in time (i.e. within trials; bSMR = 0.89, bRMR = 0.89, bAMR = 0.94, bAS = 0.96) were higher than those characterising the group as it aged (i.e. across trials; bSMR = 0.82, bRMR = 0.84, bAMR = 0.90, bAS = 0.92), and both were higher than the mean exponents for individual fish as they grew (i.e. across trials but within individuals; bSMR = 0.74, bRMR = 0.79, bAMR = 0.83, bAS = 0.85). This variation in scaling relationships, which occurred at different hierarchical levels and across time as the fish aged, may have implications for bioenergetics and ecosystem modelling and for individual ecological and physiological studies where body mass adjustments are made using specific scaling exponents to compare traits of interest between different-sized individuals. The findings suggest that studies on fish population dynamics should apply metabolic scaling exponents that are significantly higher than those used in studies on individuals. However, the generality of this assertion should be confirmed by future work, as a few existing studies on endotherms (mainly birds) have reported shallower scaling relationships for basal metabolic rate between individuals as compared to within individuals.

This creates unsolved trade-offs for the management of the stocks. We suggest a definition of a multi-species-MSY (MS-MSY) where no alternative fishing mortality (F) can in- crease yield (long term) for any ecologically interacting stock, given that the other stocks are fished at constant efforts (Fs). Such a MS-MSY can be solved through the game theoretic concept of a Nash equilibrium and here we explore two solutions to this conflict in the Baltic Sea. We maximize the sustainable yield of each stock under two constraints: first, we harvest the other stocks at a fixed F (FNE); second, we keep the spawning stock biomasses of the other stocks fixed [biomass Nash equilibrium (BNE)]. As a case study, we have developed a multi-species interaction stochastic operative model (MSI-SOM), which contains a SOM for each of the three dominant species of the Baltic Sea, the preda- tor cod (Gadus morhua), and its prey herring (Clupea harengus), and sprat (Sprattus sprattus). For our Baltic Sea case, MS-MSYs exist under both the FNE and the BNE, but there is no guarantee that point solutions exists. We found that the prey species' spawning stock biomasses are additive in the cod growth function, which allowed for a point solution in BNE. In the FNE, the herring MSY was found to be relatively in- sensitive to the other species' fishing mortalities (F), which facilitated a point solution. The MSY targets of the BNE and the FNE differ slightly where the BNE gives higher predator yields and lower prey yields.},

In this study, the spatial distribution of different life stages of cod was modelled from 1967 to 2015. The model is fit point-to-point, spatially resolved at scales of 20 km. The results show that suitability has decreased south of 56\textdegree N (\&gt;12\% in the Southern Bight) and increased north of it (with maximum of roughly 10\% in southern Skagerrak). Future changes to suitability were estimated throughout the century using temperature projections from a regional climate model under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scenario RCP8.5. The results show that southern Skagerrak, the central and northern North Sea and the edge of the Norwegian trench will remain thermally suitable for North Sea cod throughout the century. This detailed geographical representation of thermally suitable key zones for North Sea cod under climate change is revealed for the first time through the improved resolution of this analysis.},

As this body of research grows, interpretation and extrapolation to other species and systems have been limited by a lack of theory. To address the need for theory for how warming affects species interactions, we used consumer-prey models and the metabolic theory of ecology to develop quantitative predictions for how systematic differences between the temperature dependence of heterotrophic and autotrophic population growth lead to temperature-dependent herbivory. We found that herbivore and plant abundances change with temperature in proportion to the ratio of autotrophic to heterotrophic metabolic temperature dependences. This result is consistent across five different formulations of consumer-prey models and over varying resource supply rates. Two models predict that temperature-dependent herbivory causes primary producer abundance to be independent of temperature. This finding contradicts simpler extensions of metabolic theory to abundance that ignore trophic interactions, and is consistent with patterns in terrestrial ecosystems. When applied to experimental data, the model explained 77\% and 66\% of the variation in phytoplankton and zooplankton abundances, respectively. We suggest that metabolic theory provides a foundation for understanding the effects of temperature change on multitrophic ecological communities.},

  abstract = {Natural ecosystems typically consist of many small and few large organisms(1-4). The scaling of this negative relationship between body mass and abundance has important implications for resource partitioning and energy usage(5-7). Global warming over the next century is predicted to favour smaller organisms(8-12), producing steeper mass-abundance scaling(13) and a less efficient transfer of biomass through the food web(5). Here, we show that the opposite effect occurs in a natural warming experiment involving 13 whole-stream ecosystems within the same catchment, which span a temperature gradient of 5-25 degrees C. We introduce a mechanistic model that shows how the temperature dependence of basal resource carrying capacity can account for these previously unexpected results. If nutrient supply increases with temperature to offset the rising metabolic demand of primary producers, there will be sufficient resources to sustain larger consumers at higher trophic levels. These new data and the model that explains them highlight important exceptions to some commonly assumed `rules' about responses to warming in natural ecosystems.}

Fishery exploitation can be a major driver of changes in population age\textendash size structure because fisheries significantly increase mortality and often selectively remove larger and older fish. Climate change is another potential driver of shifts in the demographic structure of fish populations. Northeast Arctic (NEA) cod is the largest population of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and one of the world's most important commercial fish stocks. This population has experienced considerable changes in population age\textendash size structure over the past century, largely in response to fishing. In this study, we investigate whether changes in spawner age structure have affected population productivity in NEA cod, measured as recruits per spawning stock biomass, over the past 75 years. We find evidence that shifts in age structure toward younger spawners negatively affect population productivity, implying higher recruitment success when the spawning stock is composed of older individuals. The positive effect of an older spawning stock is likely linked to maternal effects and higher reproductive output of larger females. Our results indicate a threefold difference in productivity between the youngest and oldest spawning stock that has been observed since the 1950s. Further, our results suggest a positive effect of environmental temperature and a negative effect of intraspecific cannibalism by older juveniles on population productivity, which partly masked the effect of spawner age structure unless accounted for in the model. Collectively, these findings emphasize the importance of population age structure for the productivity of fish populations and suggest that harvest-induced demographic changes can have negative feedbacks for fisheries that lead to a younger spawning stock. Incorporating demographic data into harvest strategies could thus facilitate sustainable fishery management.},

This phenomenon has been suggested to represent a universal response to warming that may impose significant adverse effects on ecosystem functioning and services. However, we do not have a thorough understanding of why body sizes are commonly declining, and why some organisms show the opposite response. Because ectotherms constitute the vast majority of organism biomass and about 99\% of species worldwide, it is particularly important to understand how ectotherms respond to a warming climate. This review discusses the underlying physiological mechanisms of changes in ectotherm body size and addresses observed responses within a broad ecological context at different levels of organization, from individuals to communities, particularly in aquatic systems. Warming-induced responses in average body size are not only determined by changes in rates of individual growth and development, but also mediated through size-dependent feedbacks at the population level, as well as competitive and predatory interactions within the community. Emergent properties at higher organizational levels have already been observed in both experimental and natural systems. Various approaches will be required for enhancing our knowledge about the importance of such processes in natural systems. These include controlled semi-natural experiments and phylogenetic comparisons as well as statistical models of time-series data and theoretical models linking climate effects at the individual, population and community levels. Understanding causes of observed changes in organism body sizes and how these depend on the ecological context is essential for improving our predictions and the management of ecosystems in the face of a warming climate.},

We quantified changes in mean body size and contributions from shifting size-at-age and age structure of mature sockeye salmon returning to Bristol Bay, Alaska, over the past 60 years. Mean length declined by 3\%, corresponding to a 10\% decline in mean body mass, since the early 1960s, though much of this decline occurred since the early 2000s. Changes in size-at-age were the dominant cause of body size declines and were more consistent than trends in age structure among the major rivers that flow into Bristol Bay. Annual variation in size-at-age was largely explained by competition among Bristol Bay sockeye salmon and interspecific competition with other salmon in the North Pacific Ocean. Warm winters were associated with better growth of sockeye salmon, whereas warm summers were associated with reduced growth. Our findings point to competition at sea as the main driver of sockeye salmon size declines, and emphasize the trade-off between fish abundance and body size.},

Previous work suggests that the mean size and age of some North American populations of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, Salmonidae) are declining. These trends are of concern because Chinook salmon are highly valued commercially for their exceptional size and because the loss of the largest and oldest individuals may lead to reduced population productivity. Using long-\-term data from wild and hatchery populations, we quantified changes in the demographic structure of Chinook salmon populations over the past four decades across the Northeast Pacific Ocean, from California through western Alaska. Our results show that wild and hatchery fish are becoming smaller and younger throughout most of the Pacific coast. Proportions of older age classes have decreased over time in most regions. Simultaneously, the length-\-at-\-age of older fish has declined while the length-a\- t-a\- ge of younger fish has typically increased. However, negative size trends of older ages were weak or non-\-existent at the southern end of the range. While it remains to be explored whether these trends are caused by changes in climate, fishing practices or species interactions such as predation, our qualitative review of the potential causes of demographic change suggests that selective removal of large fish has likely contributed to the apparent widespread declines in average body sizes.},

The frequency and intensity of extreme events is projected to increase, especially in freshwater ecosystems. Anadromous fishes depend on freshwater habitats for spawning and juvenile rearing, making them sensitive to altered hydrologic regimes. Here, we evaluate the effect of past and projected variability in river hydrology on freshwater production of naturally spawning coho salmon populations from coastal river systems in Washington, USA. Using a stage-based life-cycle model, we show that juvenile production during freshwater residence depends on river flow characteristics. Most importantly, juvenile production is reduced by low minimum stream flows during summer. Based on climate model projections suggesting more extreme summer droughts in the region, we then simulate changes in river flow characteristics and quantify the effects of more frequent and severe low flows during summer on juvenile production as well as the harvest that can be sustained in these populations. Our results demonstrate that changes in hydrologic regimes due to environmental change, especially extreme low flows during summer, may significantly affect juvenile production in anadromous fishes such as coho salmon and the services these populations provide to their ecosystems and humans. Understanding population responses to extreme climatic events is thus essential for improving species conservation and risk assessments.},

Results: The species showed clearly different temperature selection behaviours. Vendace had a significantly higher FTP (9.0\cyrchar\CYRNJE C) than Fontane cisco (4.2\cyrchar\CYRNJE C). The FTPs comply with temperatures of minimum net swimming costs, suggesting that performance is optimized at the respective thermal preference of both species.

In coastal waters of the northeast Pacific Ocean, marine mammals have increased in abundance over the past 40 to 50 y, including fish-eating killer whales that feed primarily on Chinook salmon. Chinook salmon, a species of high cultural and economic value, have exhibited marked declines in average size and age throughout most of their North American range. This raises the question of whether size-selective predation by marine mammals is generating these trends in life-history characteristics. Here we show that increased predation since the 1970s, but not fishery selection alone, can explain the changes in age and size structure observed for Chinook salmon populations along the west coast of North America. Simulations suggest that the decline in mean size results from the selective removal of large fish and an evolutionary shift toward faster growth and earlier maturation caused by selection. Our conclusion that intensifying predation by fish-eating killer whales contributes to the continuing decline in Chinook salmon body size points to conflicting management and conservation objectives for these two iconic species.},

Yet how this translates from the individual to the population level is still poorly understood, hampering the assessment of global warming impacts on population structure and dynamics. Here, we study the effects of temperature on intraspecific competition and cannibalism and the population dynamical consequences in a size-structured fish population. We use a physiologically structured consumer-resource model in which we explicitly model the temperature dependencies of the consumer vital rates and the resource population growth rate. Our model predicts that increased temperature decreases resource density despite higher resource growth rates, reflecting stronger intraspecific competition among consumers. At a critical temperature, the consumer population dynamics destabilize and shift from a stable equilibrium to competition-driven generation cycles that are dominated by recruits. As a consequence, maximum age decreases and the proportion of younger and smaller-sized fish increases. These model predictions support the hypothesis of decreasing mean body sizes due to increased temperatures. We conclude that in size-structured fish populations, global warming may increase competition, favor smaller size classes, and induce regime shifts that destabilize population and community dynamics.},

In order to understand the ecological implications of altered seasonality, we need to consider how shifts in phenology interact with other agents of environmental change such as exploitation and disease spread, which commonly act to erode the demographic structure of wild populations. Using long-term observational data on the phenology and dynamics of a model predator-prey system (fish and zooplankton in Windermere, UK), we show that age-size truncation of the predator population alters the consequences of phenological mismatch for offspring survival and population abundance. Specifically, age-size truncation reduces intraspecific density regulation due to competition and cannibalism, and thereby amplifies the population sensitivity to climate-induced predator-prey asynchrony, which increases variability in predator abundance. High population variability poses major ecological and economic challenges as it can diminish sustainable harvest rates and increase the risk of population collapse. Our results stress the importance of maintaining within-population age-size diversity in order to buffer populations against phenological asynchrony, and highlight the need to consider interactive effects of environmental impacts if we are to understand and project complex ecological outcomes.},

Empirical data on the attack rate of northern pike (Esox lucius) feeding on brown trout (Salmo trutta) confirm this result. Attack rates fell sharply below a threshold temperature of +11 degrees C, which corresponded to a shift in relative performance of pike and brown trout with respect to maximum attack and escape swimming speeds. The average attack speed of pike was an order of magnitude lower than the escape speed of brown trout at 5 degrees C, but approximately equal at temperatures above 11 degrees C. Thresholds in the temperature dependence of ecological rates can create tipping points in the responses of ecosystems to increasing temperatures.

  abstract = {The degree to which population fluctuations arise from variable adult survival relative to variable recruitment has been debated widely for marine organisms. Disentangling these effects remains challenging because data generally are not sufficient to evaluate if and how adult survival rates are regulated by stochasticity and/or population density. Using unique time series for a largely unexploited reef fish, we found both population density and stochastic food supply impacted adult survival. The estimated effect of variable survival on adult abundance (both mean and variability) rivalled that of variable recruitment. Moreover, we show density-dependent adult survival can dampen impacts of stochastic recruitment. Thus, food variability may alter population fluctuations by simultaneously regulating recruitment and compensatory adult survival. These results provide an additional mechanism for why intensified density-independent mortality (via harvest or other means) amplifies population fluctuations and emphasises need for research evaluating the causes and consequences of variability in adult survival.},

We highlight widespread declines in Pacific salmon size based on 60 years of measurements from 12.5 million fish across Alaska, the last largely pristine North American salmon-producing region. Declines in salmon size, primarily resulting from shifting age structure, are associated with climate and competition at sea. Compared to salmon maturing before 1990, the reduced size of adult salmon after 2010 has potentially resulted in substantial losses to ecosystems and people; for Chinook salmon we estimated average per-fish reductions in egg production (-16\%), nutrient transport (-28\%), fisheries value (-21\%), and meals for rural people (-26\%). Downsizing of organisms is a global concern, and current trends may pose substantial risks for nature and people.},

  abstract = {Aim Species are expected to disperse poleward in response to climate change. For species that are endemic to the high latitudes, this implies that many in the future would face a ``no-where-to-go'' situation as they are currently occupying the northernmost portion of the continent. Further, because endemism may arise from a combination of physical barriers, climate and geological history, the persistence of many species may require spatial matching of multiple environmental factors within a limited dispersal space. Thus, it is not clear how endemic species might spatially adjust their distributions in response to climate change and whether there are future climate change refugia for these species. Location Northwest North America. Taxa Plants. Time Period Current and the future (2040). Methods We used ensemble bioclimatic models to evaluate drivers and directional patterns of future change in the distributions of 66 North American Beringian and amphi-Beringian species currently occurring in Alaska and the Yukon. We explored the spatial pattern of species richness, losses and climate change refugia across the region. Results More than 80\% of the species showed northward shifts in their latitudinal centroids under intermediate warming and are expected to shift their range northward by more than 140 km on average by 2040. Additionally, more than 60\% were projected to experience range contractions and up to 20\% of the species would have the potential to expand their ranges by more than 100\%. Main Conclusions Suitable habitat for endemic species in northwest North America is expected to decline significantly, especially for species occupying the Arctic tundra. Although the models identified several potential refugia from future climate change, especially at high latitude and elevation, whether the species would be able to colonize new habitats on their own and/or capitalize sufficiently on in situ refugia remains a pertinent conservation question.},

There was no evidence that the 2002 reform of the CFP improved decision-making, as was claimed at the time. We modelled the effects of such politically-driven decision-making on stock sustainability. Our results suggest that political adjustment of scientific recommendations dramatically increases the probability of a stock collapsing within 40 years. In 2012 European fisheries policy will undergo a once-a-decade reform. Ten years ago radical reforms were promised but the changes failed to improve sustainability. It is likely that the 2012 reform will be similarly ineffective unless decision-making is changed so that catch allocations are based on science rather than politics.},

Although conducting reviews is an efficient method of synthesising the fragmented primary evidence base, reviews that are of poor methodological reliability have the potential to misinform by not accurately reflecting the available evidence base. To assess the current value of evidence reviews for decision-making we appraised a systematic sample of articles published in early 2015 (N=92) using the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence Synthesis Assessment Tool (CEESAT). CEESAT assesses the methodology of policy-relevant evidence reviews according to elements important for objectivity, transparency and comprehensiveness. Overall, reviews performed poorly with a median score of 2.5/39 and a modal score of zero (range 0\textendash 30, mean 5.8), and low scores were ubiquitous across subject areas. In general, reviews that applied meta-analytical techniques achieved higher scores than narrative syntheses (median 18.3 and 2.0 respectively), as a result of the latter consistently failing to adequately report methodology or how conclusions were drawn. However, some narrative syntheses achieved high scores, illustrating that the reliability of reviews should be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Given the potential importance of reviews for informing management and policy, as well as research, it is vital that overall methodological reliability is improved. Although the increasing number of systematic reviews and meta-analyses highlight that some progress is being made, our findings suggest little or no improvement in the last decade. To motivate progress, we recommend that an annual assessment of the methodological reliability of evidence reviews be conducted. To better serve the environmental policy and management communities we identify a requirement for independent critical appraisal of review methodology thus enabling decision-makers to select reviews that are most likely to accurately reflect the evidence base.},

  abstract = {Under rapid environmental change, opportunistic species may exhibit dramatic increases in response to the altered conditions, and can in turn have large impacts on the ecosystem. One such species is the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), which has shown substantial increases in several aquatic systems in recent decades. Here, we review the population development of the stickleback in the Baltic Sea, a large brackish water ecosystem subject to rapid environmental change. Current evidence points to predatory release being the central driver of the population increases observed in some areas, while both eutrophication and climate change have likely contributed to creating more favourable conditions for the stickleback. The increasing stickleback densities have had profound effects on coastal ecosystem function by impairing the recruitment of piscivorous fish and enhancing the effects of eutrophication through promoting the production of filamentous algae. The increase poses a challenge for both environmental management and fisheries, where a substantial interest from the pelagic fisheries fleet in exploiting the species calls for urgent attention. While significant knowledge gaps remain, we suggest that the case of the Baltic Sea stickleback increase provides generalisable lessons of value for understanding and managing other coastal ecosystems under rapid change.},

  abstract = {A major challenge in understanding the response of populations to climate change is to separate the effects of local drivers acting independently on specific populations, from the effects of global drivers that impact multiple populations simultaneously and thereby synchronize their dynamics. We investigated the environmental drivers and the demographic mechanisms of the widespread decline in marine survival rates of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) over the last four decades. We developed a hierarchical Bayesian life cycle model to quantify the spatial synchrony in the marine survival of 13 large groups of populations (called stock units, SU) from two continental stock groups (CSG) in North America (NA) and Southern Europe (SE) over the period 1971\textendash 2014. We found strong coherence in the temporal variation in postsmolt marine survival among the 13 SU of NA and SE. A common North Atlantic trend explains 37\% of the temporal variability of the survivals for the 13 SU and declines by a factor of 1.8 over the 1971\textendash 2014 time series. Synchrony in survival trends is stronger between SU within each CSG. The common trends at the scale of NA and SE capture 60\% and 42\% of the total variance of temporal variations, respectively. Temporal variations of the postsmolt survival are best explained by the temporal variations of sea surface temperature (SST, negative correlation) and net primary production indices (PP, positive correlation) encountered by salmon in common domains during their marine migration. Specifically, in the Labrador Sea/Grand Banks for populations from NA, 26\% and 24\% of variance is captured by SST and PP, respectively and in the Norwegian Sea for populations from SE, 21\% and 12\% of variance is captured by SST and PP, respectively. The findings support the hypothesis of a response of salmon populations to large climate-induced changes in the North Atlantic simultaneously impacting populations from distant continental habitats.},

Resulting impacts of stickleback on coastal and offshore foodwebs have been observed, highlighting the need for increased knowledge on its population characteristics. In this article, we quantify abundance, biomass, size structure, and spatial distribution of stickleback using data from the Swedish and Finnish parts of the Baltic International Acoustic Survey (BIAS) during 2001\textendash 2014. Two alternative methods for biomass estimation suggest an increase in biomass of stickleback in the Baltic Proper, stable or increasing mean size over time, and larger individuals toward the north. The highest abundance was found in the central parts of the Baltic Proper and Bothnian Sea. The proportion of stickleback biomass in the total planktivore biomass increased from 4 to 10\% in the Baltic Proper and averaged 6\% of the total planktivore biomass in the Bothnian Sea. In some years, however, stickleback biomass has ranged from half to almost twice that of sprat (Sprattus sprattus) in both basins. Given the recent population expansion of stickleback and its potential role in the ecosystem, we recommend that stickleback should be considered in future monitoring programmes and in fisheries and environmental management of the Baltic Sea.},

The interplay among individual actors, organizations, and institutions at multiple levels is central in such transitions. A flexible organization, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, was crucial in initiating the transition to ecosystem-based management. This agency was also instrumental in the subsequent transformation of the governance regime and provided leadership throughout the process. Strategies involved internal reorganization and management innovation, leading to an ability to coordinate the scientific community, to increase public awareness of environmental issues and problems, to involve a broader set of stakeholders, and to maneuver the political system for support at critical times. The transformation process was induced by increased pressure on the Great Barrier Reef (from terrestrial runoff, overharvesting, and global warming) that triggered a new sense of urgency to address these challenges. The focus of governance shifted from protection of selected individual reefs to stewardship of the larger-scale seascape. The study emphasizes the significance of stewardship that can change patterns of interactions among key actors and allow for new forms of management and governance to emerge in response to environmental change. This example illustrates that enabling legislations or other social bounds are essential, but not sufficient for shifting governance toward adaptive comanagement of complex marine ecosystems.},

Density in aggregations can reach 100 to more than 1000 times the average density of the population as estimated by net sampling. In order to assess true abundance of the animals and understand the significance of the aggregations, more information is needed on the behavior and population ecology of individual species and the species-specific attributes of discrete assemblages. We present information on patterns of intense aggregations of protozoans, platyhelminthes, scyphomedusae, copepods, mysids, and sergestids from our own observations. Characteristics behaviors of different species include feeding swarms of Noctiluca miliaris, behaviorally maintained swarms of planktonic flatworms, diel horizontal migration of Mastigias sp. swarms, three patterns of copepod swarms, bathymetric zonation of mysid schools, and seasonal migration and near bottom swarming of Sergia lucens. After the principles were demonstrated, we consider how to relate sampling, behavior, and population dynamics. We stress that the methodology is the result of the question, not the other way round. To tackle the problems associated with ``behavior'' in the open ocean, which we did not observe from the surface, it is necessary to sample in more than one way to extract data on differences in population-specific biology that alternative methods supply.},

Many SDMs have been developed over the past decades, with a focus on space- and more recently, time-dependence. However, most of these studies have been on terrestrial species and applications to marine species have been limited. In this study, we used three large spatio-temporal data sources (habitat maps, survey-based fish density estimates, and fishery catch data) and a novel space-time model to study how the distribution of fishing may affect the seasonal dynamics of a commercially important fish species (Pacific Dover sole, Microstomus pacificus) off the west coast of the USA. Dover sole showed a large scale change in seasonal and annual distribution of biomass, and its distribution shifted from mid-depth zones to inshore or deeper waters during late summer/early fall. In many cases, the scale of fishery removal was small compared to these broader changes in biomass, suggesting that seasonal dynamics were primarily driven by movement and not by fishing. The increasing availability of appropriate data and space-time modeling software should facilitate extending this work to many other species, particularly those in marine ecosystems, and help tease apart the role of growth, natural mortality, recruitment, movement, and fishing on spatial patterns of species distribution in marine systems.},

  abstract = {Abstract Aim The interdependencies between trophic interactions, environmental factors and anthropogenic forcing determine how species distributions change over time. Large changes in species distributions have occurred as a result of climate change. The objective of this study was to analyse how the spatial distribution of cod and flounder has changed in the Baltic Sea during the past four decades characterized by large hydrological changes. Location Baltic Sea Taxon Cod (Gadus morhua) and flounder (Platichthys flesus). Methods Catch per unit of effort (CPUE) data for adult and juvenile cod and for adult flounder were modelled using Delta-Generalized additive models including environmental and geographical variables between 1979 and 2016. From the annual CPUE predictions for each species, yearly distribution maps and depth distribution curves were obtained. Mean depth and the depth range were estimated to provide an indication on preferred depth and habitat occupancy. Results Adult and juvenile cod showed a contraction in their distribution in the southern areas of the Baltic Sea. Flounder, instead, showed an expansion in its distribution with an increase in abundance in the northern areas. The depth distributions showed a progressive shift of the mean depth of occurrence towards shallower waters for adult cod and flounder and towards deeper waters for juvenile cod, as well as a contraction of the species depth ranges, evident mainly from the late 1980s. Main conclusions Our study illustrates large changes in the spatial distribution of cod and flounder in the Baltic Sea. The changes in depth distribution occurred from the late 1980s are probably due to a combination of expanded areas of hypoxia in deep waters and an increase in predation risk in shallow waters. The net effect of these changes is an increased spatial overlap between life stages and species, which may amplify cod cannibalism and the interaction strength between cod and flounder.},

  abstract = {Direct observations indicate that the global ocean oxygen inventory is decreasing. Climate models consistently confirm this decline and predict continuing and accelerating ocean deoxygenation. However, current models (1) do not reproduce observed patterns for oxygen changes in the ocean's thermocline; (2) underestimate the temporal variability of oxygen concentrations and air\textendash sea fluxes inferred from time-series observations; and (3) generally simulate only about half the oceanic oxygen loss inferred from observations. We here review current knowledge about the mechanisms and drivers of oxygen changes and their variation with region and depth over the world's oceans. Warming is considered a major driver: in part directly, via solubility effects, and in part indirectly, via changes in circulation, mixing and oxygen respiration. While solubility effects have been quantified and found to dominate deoxygenation near the surface, a quantitative understanding of contributions from other mechanisms is still lacking. Current models may underestimate deoxygenation because of unresolved transport processes, unaccounted for variations in respiratory oxygen demand, or missing biogeochemical feedbacks. Dedicated observational programmes are required to better constrain biological and physical processes and their representation in models to improve our understanding and predictions of patterns and intensity of future oxygen change.},

Here, we leverage both types of information using paleoclimate data assimilation9,10 to produce the first proxy-constrained, full-field reanalysis of surface temperature change spanning the Last Glacial Maximum to present at 200-year resolution. We demonstrate that temperature variability across the past 24\,thousand years was linked to two primary climatic mechanisms: radiative forcing from ice sheets and greenhouse gases; and a superposition of changes in the ocean overturning circulation and seasonal insolation. In contrast with previous proxy-based reconstructions6,7 our results show that global mean temperature has slightly but steadily warmed, by \textasciitilde 0.5\,\textdegree C, since the early Holocene (around 9~thousand years ago).

However, it is not known how the TSR affects community dynamics. Here we integrate temperature- and size-dependent models to include indirect effects of warming, through changes in body size, to answer the question, How does the TSR affect the predicted response of consumer-resource systems to warming? We find that the TSR is expected to maintain consumer-resource biomass ratios and buffer the community from extinctions under warming. While our results are limited to conditions where organisms are below their thermal optimum, they hold under a range of realistic temperature-size responses and are robust to the type of functional response. Our analyses suggest that the widely observed TSR may reduce the impacts of warming on consumerresource systems.},

It is intuitive that the size and state of the spawning stock, the adult part of the fish population, is important for recruitment. Additionally, environmental conditions can greatly influence survival through vulnerable early life stages until recruitment. To understand what regulates recruitment, an essential part of fish population dynamics, it is thus necessary to explain the impact of fluctuations in both spawning stock and environment, including interactions. Here, we examine if the connection between the environment and recruitment is affected by the state of the spawning stock, including biomass, mean age and age diversity. Specifically, we re-evaluate the hypothesis stating that recruitment from a spawning stock dominated by young fish and few age classes is more vulnerable to environmental fluctuations. We expand upon earlier work on the Barents Sea stock of Atlantic cod, now with data series extended in time both backwards and forwards to cover the period 1922\textendash 2019. While our findings are correlative and cannot prove a specific cause and effect mechanism, they support earlier work and strengthen the evidence for the hypothesis above. Furthermore, this study supports that advice to fisheries management should include considerations of environmental status.},

To facilitate the integration between conceptual and statistical approaches in community ecology, we propose Hierarchical Modelling of Species Communities (HMSC) as a general, flexible framework for modern analysis of community data. While non-manipulative data allow for only correlative and not causal inference, this framework facilitates the formulation of data-driven hypotheses regarding the processes that structure communities. We model environmental filtering by variation and covariation in the responses of individual species to the characteristics of their environment, with potential contingencies on species traits and phylogenetic relationships. We capture biotic assembly rules by species-to-species association matrices, which may be estimated at multiple spatial or temporal scales. We operationalise the HMSC framework as a hierarchical Bayesian joint species distribution model, and implement it as R- and Matlab-packages which enable computationally efficient analyses of large data sets. Armed with this tool, community ecologists can make sense of many types of data, including spatially explicit data and time-series data. We illustrate the use of this framework through a series of diverse ecological examples.},

We show how these two factors can be separated by multivariate logistic regression, with the regression part accounting for species-specific habitat requirements, and a correlation matrix for the positive or negative residual associations. We parameterize the model using Bayesian inference with data on 22 species of wood-decaying fungi acquired in 14 dissimilar forest sites. Our analyses reveal that some of the species commonly found to occur together in the same logs are likely to do so merely by similar habitat requirements, whereas other species combinations are systematically either over- or underrepresented also or only after accounting for the habitat requirements.

We demonstrate how earlier emergence from hibernation and earlier weaning of young has led to a longer growing season and larger body masses before hibernation. The resulting shift in both the phenotype and the relationship between phenotype and fitness components led to a decline in adult mortality, which in turn triggered an abrupt increase in population size in recent years. Direct and trait-mediated effects of environmental change made comparable contributions to the observed marked increase in population growth. Our results help explain how a shift in phenology can cause simultaneous phenotypic and demographic changes, and highlight the need for a theory integrating ecological and evolutionary dynamics in stochastic environments.},

Sometimes, however, transformation fails to linearize the observations, thereby giving rise to what has come to be known as non-loglinear allometry. A smooth curve for observations displayed on a log\textendash log plot is usually interpreted to mean that the scaling exponent in the allometric equation is a continuously changing function of body size, whereas a breakpoint between two (or more) linear segments on a log\textendash log plot is typically taken to mean that the exponent changes abruptly, coincident with some important milestone in development. I applied simple graphical and statistical procedures in re-analyses of three well-known examples of non-loglinear allometry, and showed in every instance that the relationship between predictor and response can be described in the original scale by simple functions with constant values for the exponent b. In no instance does the allometric exponent change during the course of development. Transformation of data to logarithms created new distributions that actually obscured the relationships between predictor and response variables in these investigations, and led to erroneous perceptions of growth. Such confounding effects of transformation are not limited to non-loglinear allometry but are common to all applications of the allometric method. \textcopyright{} 2012 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2012, \textbullet\textbullet, \textbullet\textbullet\textendash\textbullet\textbullet.},

In both instances investigators were led to conclusions that are not supported by the original data. Problems of the sort described here can readily be avoided simply by performing preliminary graphical analysis of observations expressed in the original units and by validating the final model in the arithmetic domain.},

Given the growth in consumption of seafood, combined with the compounding effects of habitat loss, climate change, and pollution, there is a need to identify recovery paths, particularly in poorly managed and poorly monitored fisheries. Here, we document conservation through fisheries management success for 11 coastal sharks in US waters by comparing population trends through a Bayesian state-space model before and after the implementation of the 1993 Fisheries Management Plan for Sharks. We took advantage of the spatial and temporal gradients in fishing exposure and fisheries management in the Western Atlantic to analyze the effect on the Red List status of all 26 wide-ranging coastal sharks and rays. We show that extinction risk was greater where fishing pressure was higher, but this was offset by the strength of management engagement (indicated by strength of National and Regional Plan of Action for sharks and rays). The regional Red List Index (which tracks changes in extinction risk through time) declined in all regions until the 1980s but then improved in the North and Central Atlantic such that the average extinction risk is currently half that in the Southwest. Many sharks and rays are wide ranging, and successful fisheries management in one country can be undone by poorly regulated or unregulated fishing elsewhere. Our study underscores that well-enforced, science-based management of carefully monitored fisheries can achieve conservation success, even for slow-growing species.},

Here, we investigate how microbial community structure changes as a consequence of rapidly evolved within-species diversity using Pseudomonas fluorescens as a focal species. Evolved P. fluorescens populations showed substantial phenotypic diversification in resource-use (and correlated genomic change) irrespective of whether they were pre-adapted in isolation or in a community context. Manipulating diversity revealed that more diverse P. fluorescens populations had the greatest impact on community structure, by suppressing some bacterial taxa, but facilitating others.

Here, we show that selection on photosynthetic traits within and across taxa dampens the effects of temperature on GPP across a catchment of geothermally heated streams. Autotrophs from cold streams had higher photosynthetic rates and after accounting for differences in biomass among sites, biomass-specific GPP was independent of temperature in spite of a 20 \textdegree C thermal gradient.

  abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms that determine how phytoplankton adapt to warming will substantially improve the realism of models describing ecological and biogeochemical effects of climate change. Here, we quantify the evolution of elevated thermal tolerance in the phytoplankton, Chlorella vulgaris. Initially, population growth was limited at higher temperatures because respiration was more sensitive to temperature than photosynthesis meaning less carbon was available for growth. Tolerance to high temperature evolved after \% 100 generations via greater down-regulation of respiration relative to photosynthesis. By down-regulating respiration, phytoplankton overcame the metabolic constraint imposed by the greater temperature sensitivity of respiration and more efficiently allocated fixed carbon to growth. Rapid evolution of carbon-use efficiency provides a potentially general mechanism for thermal adaptation in phytoplankton and implies that evolutionary responses in phytoplankton will modify biogeochemical cycles and hence food web structure and function under warming. Models of climate futures that ignore adaptation would usefully be revisited.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}1. The quantification of thermal performance curves (TPCs) for biological rates has many applications to problems such as predicting species9 responses to climate change. There is currently no widely used open-source pipeline to fit mathematical TPC models to data, which limits the transparency and reproducibility of the curve fitting process underlying applications of TPCs. 2. We present a new pipeline in R that currently allows for reproducible fitting of 24 different TPC models using non-linear least squares (NLLS) regression. The pipeline consists of two packages - rTPC and nls.multstart - that allow multiple start values for NLLS fitting and provides helper functions for setting start parameters. This pipeline overcomes previous problems that have made NLLS fitting and estimation of key parameters difficult or unreliable. 3. We demonstrate how rTPC and nls.multstart can be combined with other packages in R to robustly and reproducibly fit multiple models to multiple TPC datasets at once. In addition, we show how model selection or averaging, weighted model fitting, and bootstrapping can easily be implemented within the pipeline. 4. This new pipeline provides a flexible and reproducible approach that makes the challenging task of fitting multiple TPC models to data accessible to a wide range of users.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The bacteriophage had a narrower thermal tolerance for infection, with their critical thermal maximum \textasciitilde 6\,\textdegree C lower than those at which the bacteria still had high growth. Consequently, in the presence of phage, the host TPC changed, resulting in a lower maximum growth rate. These changes were not just driven by differences in thermal tolerance, with temperature-dependent costs of evolved resistance also playing a major role: the largest cost of resistance occurred at the temperature at which bacteria grew best in the absence of phage. Our work highlights how ecological and evolutionary mechanisms can alter the effect of a parasite on host thermal performance, even over very short timescales.},

  abstract = {Individual growth rates of the freshwater amphipod Hyalella azteca (Saussure) were measured in the littoral zone of two small oligotrophic Ontario lakes and in growth experiments over a natural temperature gradient (10, 15, 20, and 23\cyrchar\CYRNJE C). Field observations showed that a temperature of 20\cyrchar\CYRNJE C is important for both the induction and termination of reproductive resting stages in H. azteca. Growth rates were more affected by temperature in small than in large individuals. Growth parameters are related to rearing temperature by linear regressions, which can be used as a simple model for bioenergetics calculations in crustaceans. A negative relationship between water temperature and maximum size attained by the amphipods was found. The largest adults were absent in studied populations when summer temperatures were high, and this phenomenon, which has also been observed in other aquatic invertebrates, was bioenergetically determined. Energy-budget estimations showed negative net growth efficiency (K2) in the largest adults at temperatures above 20\cyrchar\CYRNJE C. The relationship between K2 and temperature showed a dome-shaped pattern, K2 values for larger amphipods being maximal at lower temperatures. Seasonal migrations of adult H. azteca from shallow littoral to deeper cold habitats, observed in lakes during the warmest periods, appear to be temperature-induced and bioenergetically advantageous, despite probable increases in predation risk experienced in spatially simple deep-water habitats.},

Liver condition was found to vary with region and depth, tending to be highest in deeper water and in the northern and eastern regions; where temperatures were relatively cold and capelin consumption relatively high. A continuous decline in condition of cod in waters off the east coast was observed throughout the study period. Mature cod were found to be in significantly better condition than immature cod of the same age, and mature females were in better condition than mature males. Different patterns emerged from the 2 condition indices; little variation in Kr was observed whereas H was found to be a dynamic index of condition, suggesting that these metrics are not equivalent measures of cod bioenergetic condition.},

Here, we explore these differences, apply diverse analyses to more than 1,700 species, and show that recent biological trends match climate change predictions. Global meta-analyses documented significant range shifts averaging 6.1\,km per decade towards the poles (or metres per decade upward), and significant mean advancement of spring events by 2.3 days per decade. We define a diagnostic fingerprint of temporal and spatial `sign-switching' responses uniquely predicted by twentieth century climate trends. Among appropriate long-term/large-scale/multi-species data sets, this diagnostic fingerprint was found for 279 species. This suite of analyses generates `very high confidence' (as laid down by the IPCC) that climate change is already affecting living systems.},

We suggest that catch actually peaked at 130 million tonnes, and has been declining much more strongly since. This decline in reconstructed catches reflects declines in industrial catches and to a smaller extent declining discards, despite industrial fishing having expanded from industrialized countries to the waters of developing countries.

  abstract = {The gill-oxygen limitation theory (GOLT) provides mechanisms for key aspects of the biology (food conversion efficiency, growth and its response to temperature, the timing of maturation, and others) of water-breathing ectotherms (WBEs). The GOLT's basic tenet is that the surface area of the gills or other respiratory surfaces of WBE cannot, as two-dimensional structures, supply them with sufficient oxygen to keep up with the growth of their three-dimensional bodies. Thus, a lower relative oxygen supply induces sexual maturation, and later a slowing and cessation of growth, along with an increase of physiological processes relying on glycolytic enzymes and a declining role of oxidative enzymes. Because the ``dimensional tension'' underlying this argument is widely misunderstood, emphasis is given to a detailed refutation of objections to the GOLT. This theory still needs to be put on a solid quantitative basis, which will occur after the misconceptions surrounding it are put to rest. The gill-oxygen limitation theory (GOLT) explains many previously unexplained aspects of the life history of fish.

The growth of adult crustaceans therefore approaches an asymptote, whether or not seasonal growth oscillations are explicitly considered in the model used to describe that growth (e.g., von Bertalanffy growth function). On the other hand, the variation in asymptotic size (L{$\infty$} or W{$\infty$}) among crustaceans is primarily determined by water temperature, which impacts on the oxygen requirements of WBE. Through multiple examples, this and related aspects of the Gill-Oxygen Limitation Theory (GOLT), first developed for fishes and later extended to other WBE, are shown to also apply to the growth of a wide range of crustacean taxa. The GOLT also explains certain aspects of crustacean reproduction, such as the relationship between size at first maturity and maximum size, and, possibly, the feature that female crustaceans hold their eggs outside of their bodies instead of internally.},

  abstract = {One of the main expected responses of marine fishes to ocean warming is decrease in body size, as supported by evidence from empirical data and theoretical modeling. The theoretical underpinning for fish shrinking is that the oxygen supply to large fish size cannot be met by their gills, whose surface area cannot keep up with the oxygen demand by their three-dimensional bodies. However, Lefevre et al. (Global Change Biology, 2017, 23, 3449\textendash 3459) argue against such theory. Here, we reassert, with the Gill-Oxygen Limitation Theory (GOLT), that gills, which must retain the properties of open surfaces because their growth, even while hyperallometric, cannot keep up with the demand of growing three-dimensional bodies. Also, we show that a wide range of biological features of fish and other water-breathing organisms can be understood when gill area limitation is used as an explanation. We also note that an alternative to GOLT, offering a more parsimonious explanation for these features of water-breathers has not been proposed. Available empirical evidence corroborates predictions of decrease in body sizes under ocean warming based on GOLT, with the magnitude of the predicted change increases when using more species-specific parameter values of metabolic scaling.},

Knowledge of how trophic interaction strengths are affected by differences among habitats is crucial for understanding variation in ecological systems. Here we show how substantial variation in consumption-rate data, and hence trophic interaction strengths, arises because consumers tend to encounter resources more frequently in three dimensions (3D) (for example, arboreal and pelagic zones) than two dimensions (2D) (for example, terrestrial and benthic zones). By combining new theory with extensive data (376 species, with body masses ranging from 5.24 \texttimes{} 10-14 kg to 800 kg), we find that consumption rates scale sublinearly with consumer body mass (exponent of approximately 0.85) for 2D interactions, but superlinearly (exponent of approximately 1.06) for 3D interactions. These results contradict the currently widespread assumption of a single exponent (of approximately 0.75) in consumer\textendash resource and food-web research. Further analysis of 2,929 consumer\textendash resource interactions shows that dimensionality of consumer search space is probably a major driver of species coexistence, and the stability and abundance of populations.},

  abstract = {Whether the thermal sensitivity of an organism's traits follows the simple Boltzmann-Arrhenius model remains a contentious issue that centers around consideration of its operational temperature range and whether the sensitivity corresponds to one or a few underlying rate-limiting enzymes. Resolving this issue is crucial, because mechanistic models for temperature dependence of traits are required to predict the biological effects of climate change. Here, by combining theory with data on 1,085 thermal responses from a wide range of traits and organisms, we show that substantial variation in thermal sensitivity (activation energy) estimates can arise simply because of variation in the range of measured temperatures. Furthermore, when thermal responses deviate systematically from the Boltzmann-Arrhenius model, variation in measured temperature ranges across studies can bias estimated activation energy distributions toward higher mean, median, variance, and skewness. Remarkably, this bias alone can yield activation energies that encompass the range expected from biochemical reactions (from {$\sim$}0.2 to 1.2 eV), making it difficult to establish whether a single activation energy appropriately captures thermal sensitivity. We provide guidelines and a simple equation for partially correcting for such artifacts. Our results have important implications for understanding the mechanistic basis of thermal responses of biological traits and for accurately modeling effects of variation in thermal sensitivity on responses of individuals, populations, and ecological communities to changing climatic temperatures.},

This pattern is thought to reflect trends in temperature variability: tropical ectotherms evolve to be 'thermal specialists' because their environment is thermally stable. How-ever, the tropics are also hotter, and most physiological rates increase exponentially with tempera-ture. Using a dataset spanning diverse ectotherms, we show that the temperature ranges ectotherms tolerate (the difference between lower and upper critical temperatures, and between optimum and upper critical temperatures) generally represents the same range of equivalent bio-logical rates (e.g. metabolism) for cool-and warm-adapted species, and independent of latitude or elevation. This suggests that geographical trends in temperature variability may not be the ulti-mate mechanism underlying latitudinal and elevational trends in thermal tolerance. Rather, we propose that tropical ectotherms can perform over a narrower range of temperatures than species from higher latitudes because the tropics are hotter.},

We apply a climate risk analysis across the European fisheries sector to identify the most at-risk fishing fleets and coastal regions and then link the two analyses together. We employ an approach combining biological traits with physiological metrics to differentiate climate hazards between 556 populations of fish and use these to assess the relative climate risk for 380 fishing fleets and 105 coastal regions in Europe. Countries in southeast Europe as well as the United Kingdom have the highest risks to both fishing fleets and coastal regions overall, while in other countries, the risk-profile is greater at either the fleet level or at the regional level. European fisheries face a diversity of challenges posed by climate change; climate adaptation, therefore, needs to be tailored to each country, region, and fleet's specific situation. Our analysis supports this process by highlighting where and what adaptation measures might be needed and informing where policy and business responses could have the greatest impact.},

Here, we demonstrate the application of decadal-scale climate predictions to the habitat and distribution of marine fish species. We show statistically significant forecast skill of individual years that outperform baseline forecasts 3\textendash 10 years ahead; forecasts of multi-year averages perform even better, yielding correlation coefficients in excess of 0.90 in some cases.

  abstract = {Energy flow through the major compartments of the ecosystem of the south-east Kattegat has been assessed based on observations made between 1985\textendash 1989. In this increasingly eutrophic semi-estuarine coastal area, energy inputs are dominated by autochthonous production during the spring and autumn bloom periods ({$>$}90\%), and by allochthonous fluvial sources during the winter ({$>$}50\%). An unbalanced annual carbon budget is presented, which demonstrates the predominance of infaunal benthic suspension feeders in the shallow areas (above 13 m), where their demand alone is 2.4 times the calculated carbon supply to the sediment. Benthic demand does not diminish below 13 m, but the proportion utilized by macrofaunal deposit feeders and meiofauna increases with lower suspension feeder demand, emphasizing the close coupling between pelagos and benthos at all depths in this system. Excess benthic demand over planktonic production is assumed to be met by lateral imports across the system boundaries. Intermittent summer hypoxia below the halocline (mean depth 15 m) has a severe effect on the benthos of the area, leading to a reduction in epifaunal predation prior to the reduction of macrobenthic organisms. Such events lead to the temporary accumulation of sedimentary carbon before late autumnal mixing initiates the reoxygenation and eventual recolonization of the affected areas. Comparisons with published carbon budgets for the Chesapeake Bay and the Baltic Sea suggest major differences between the relative roles of pelagos, and benthos in these systems. In the Baltic, which is fuelled predominantly by autochthonous processes, pelagic carbon flows are about 4 times those of the benthos. Allochthonous inputs predominate throughout much of the year in the Chesapeake Bay, where pelagic flows are proportionately 1.5 \texttimes{} those of the benthos, whereas in the SE Kattegat benthic flows exceed those within the pelagos by about 25. The higher populations of epifaunal and nektonic predators found in the SE Kattegat system, as opposed to the other two systems, is a corollary of the greater energy flows through the benthic components. The demonstrable vulnerability to anoxia of these commercially important organisms emphasizes the sensitivity of such coastal systems to the consequences of increased nutrient inputs.},

Detecting shifts is straightforward in single-species time series when transitions are detectable as periods of rapid change. However, shifts in complex and spatially structured communities may be harder to detect. We propose an approach to characterize community regime shifts, using nonparametric spatiotemporal regression models to estimate three indicators of community change (the among-species mean rate of change, mean per-capita rate of change, and standard deviation of per-capita rate of change). These indicators can detect shifts that result in either changes in abundance or composition. We applied our approach to a 37-year community biomass time series that spans the Newfoundland Shelf groundfish collapse. Our method detected a community shift earlier than alternative single-indicator breakpoint approaches and gave additional insight into the spatiotemporal pattern of the change, including detecting three separate periods of change and characterizing the first locations to show signs of recovery. The indicators applied in this study provide novel insights into Newfoundland groundfish dynamics and should be useful in the characterization of other abrupt ecological changes.},

  abstract = {Lakes are vulnerable to climate change, and warming rates in the Arctic are faster than anywhere on Earth. Fishes are sensitive to changing temperatures, which directly control physiological processes. Food availability should partly dictate responses to climate change because energetic demands change with temperature, but few studies have simultaneously examined temperature and food availability. We used a fully factorial experiment to test effects of food availability and temperature (7.6, 12.7, and 17.4\textdegree C; 50 days) on growth, consumption, respiration, and excretion, and effects of temperature (12 and 19.3\textdegree C; 27 days) on habitat use and growth of a common, but understudied, mid-level consumer, slimy sculpin Cottus cognatus, in arctic lakes. We also used bioenergetics modelling to predict consumptive demand under future warming scenarios. Growth rates were 3.4\texttimes{} higher at 12.7\textdegree C in high food compared to low food treatments, but the magnitude of differences depended on temperature. Within low food treatments, there was no statistical difference in growth rates among temperatures, suggesting food limitation. Consumption, respiration, and nitrogen excretion increased with temperature independent of food availability. Lower growth rates coincided with lower phosphorus excretion at the highest temperature, suggesting that fish selectively retained phosphorus at high temperatures and low food. In habitat choice experiments, fish were more likely to use the 12\textdegree C side of the tank, closely matching their optimal temperature. We predicted a 9\% increase in consumption is required to maintain observed growth under a 4\textdegree C warming scenario. These results highlight considering changes in food resources and other associated indirect effects (e.g. excretion) that accompany changing temperatures with climate change. Depending on how food webs respond to warming, fish may cope with predicted warming if density-dependent feedback maintains population sizes.},

Here, by analysing ectotherm death time curves that take into consideration the intensity and duration of a thermal challenge, we show that heat tolerance varies predictably with size. Smaller animals can maintain higher body temperatures than larger ones during short periods, but cannot maintain higher body temperatures over long periods as their endurance declines more rapidly with time. Body size effects and adaptive variation in heat tolerance may have been obscured in the past by these unaccounted for temporal effects. With increasing size, thermal death occurs at relatively lower metabolic rates with respect to rest at a non-stressful temperature, which might partly explain the reported reductions in organism size with climate warming and shed light on the mechanisms that underlie scaling.},

Being able to determine how species associations change along environmental gradients is likely to be pivotal in exploring the magnitude of future changes in species' distributions. This is particularly important in connectivity-limited ecosystems, such as freshwater ecosystems, where increased human translocation is creating species associations over previously unseen environmental gradients. Here, we use a large-scale presence\textendash absence dataset of freshwater fish from lakes across the Fennoscandian region in a Joint Species Distribution Model, to measure the effect of temperature on species associations. We identified a trend of negative associations between species tolerant of cold waters and those tolerant of warmer waters, as well as positive associations between several more warm-tolerant species, with these associations often shifting depending on local temperatures. Our results confirm that freshwater ecosystems can expect to see a large-scale shift towards communities dominated by more warm-tolerant species. While there remains much work to be done to predict exactly where and when local extinctions may take place, the model implemented provides a starting-point for the exploration of climate-driven community trends. This approach is especially informative in regards to determining which species associations are most central in shaping future community composition, and which areas are most vulnerable to local extinctions.},

In contrast, evidence for shifts in trophic cascades caused by intrinsically driven population dynamics is meager. By using empirical data of a cannibalistic fish population covering a 10-year period and a size-structured population model, we show the occurrence of a dynamic trophic cascade in a lake ecosystem, in which the community over time alternates between two different configurations. The intrinsically driven change in the size structure of the fish population from a dominance of stunted individuals to a dominance of gigantic cannibals among adult individuals is the driving force behind distinct abundance switches observed in zooplankton and phytoplankton. The presence of the phase with gigantic cannibals depends critically on the energy they extract from their victims, allowing strong reproduction for a number of years.},

A strong long-term effect of roach on the zooplankton resource but not on the macroinvertebrate resource was present. Competitive effects of roach on perch were observed in one of the lakes the first years after the introduction, but at the end of the study no competitive effect of roach on either size class of perch was observed in any of the two lakes. In contrast, a positive predatory effect reflected in improved growth rates of older perch was present. 4. The lack of a support for a competitive effect of roach on small perch raises the question of the importance of mixed competition-predation interactions in life-history omnivorous systems and the problem of comparing descriptive data on feeding relationships with theoretical predictions based on interaction modules.},

Eutrophication by means of nutrient enrichment is shown to be a process of the last three decades. It is assumed that primary production has doubled during this time. Macrobenthic data from the southern Baltic indicate highly increased biomass values above the halocline between the 1920s and 1950s. During the last three decades no biomass increase was found. Because of these facts, eutrophication is rejected as a major cause of increased macrobenthic biomass. Flatfish populations in the southern Baltic were very dense before the 1920s. This resulted in stunted growth due to strong competition for food. After heavy exploitation in the 1920s and the early 1930s, these stocks were thinned out and showed significantly higher growth rates due to the reduced competition. In the late 1930s the catches of cod increased markedly. Based on evidence from studies of predator-prey relationships it is proposed that the increased macrobenthic biomass values are due to the decreased grazing pressure following the exploitation of the flatfishes. Furthermore, it is assumed that the increase of the stock of cod in the 1930s was due to reduced food competition between young cod and flatfishes, especially the dab.},

Here, we develop a model of how temperature affects food web connectance, a powerful driver of population dynamics and community structure. We use the Arrhenius equation to add temperature dependence of foraging traits to an existing model of food web structure. The model predicts potentially large temperature effects on connectance. Temperature-sensitive food webs exhibit slopes of up to 0.01 units of connectance per 1 degrees C change in temperature. This corresponds to changes in diet breadth of one resource item per 2 degrees C (assuming a food web containing 50 species). Less sensitive food webs exhibit slopes down to 0.0005, which corresponds to about one resource item per 40 degrees C. Relative sizes of the activation energies of attack rate and handling time determine whether warming increases or decreases connectance. Differences in temperature sensitivity are explained by differences between empirical food webs in the body size distributions of organisms. We conclude that models of temperature effects on community structure and dynamics urgently require considerable development, and also more and better empirical data to parameterize and test them.},

Metabolic rate is related to an organism's capacity for essential maintenance, growth and reproduction\textemdash all of which interact to affect fitness. Although thousands of measurements of metabolic rate have been made, the microevolutionary forces that shape metabolic rate remain poorly resolved. The relationship between metabolic rate and components of fitness are often inconsistent, possibly because these fitness components incompletely map to actual fitness and often negatively covary with each other. Here we measure metabolic rate across ontogeny and monitor its effects on actual fitness (lifetime reproductive output) for a marine bryozoan in the field. We also measure key components of fitness throughout the entire life history including growth rate, longevity and age at the onset of reproduction. We found that correlational selection favours individuals with higher metabolic rates in one stage and lower metabolic rates in the other\textemdash individuals with similar metabolic rates in each developmental stage displayed the lowest fitness. Furthermore, individuals with the lowest metabolic rates lived for longer and reproduced more, but they also grew more slowly and took longer to reproduce initially. That metabolic rate is related to the pace of the life history in nature has long been suggested by macroevolutionary patterns but this study reveals the microevolutionary processes that probably generated these patterns.},

By linking metabolic and life-history theory, we provide a general explanation for why larger offspring perform better than smaller offspring. Using high-throughput respirometry arrays, we link metabolic rate to offspring size in two species of marine bryozoan. We found that metabolism scales allometrically with offspring size in both species: while larger offspring use absolutely more energy than smaller offspring, larger offspring use proportionally less of their maternally derived energy throughout the dependent, non-feeding phase. The increased metabolic efficiency of larger offspring while dependent on maternal investment may explain offspring size effects-larger offspring reach nutritional independence (feed for themselves) with a higher proportion of energy relative to structure than smaller offspring. These findings offer a potentially universal explanation for why larger offspring tend to perform better than smaller offspring but studies on other taxa are needed.},

We measured at-sea behaviour of a central-place forager, the little penguin (Eudyptula minor), over 5 years (2015\textendash 2019) using GPS and dive loggers. We made contemporaneous measurements of the prey field within the penguins' foraging range via boat-based acoustic surveys. We developed a prey encounter index by comparing estimates of acoustic prey density encountered along actual penguin tracks to those encountered along simulated penguin tracks with the same characteristics as real tracks but that moved randomly through the prey field. In most years, penguin tracks encountered prey better than simulated random movements greater than 99\% of the time, and penguin dive depths matched peaks in the vertical distribution of prey. However, when prey was unusually sparse and/or deep, penguins had worse than random prey encounter indices, exhibited dives that mismatched depth of maximum prey density, and females had abnormally low body mass (5.3\% lower than average). Reductions in prey encounters owing to decreases in the density or accessibility of prey may ultimately lead to reduced fitness and population declines in central-place foraging marine predators.},

Routine oxygen consumption of fishes fed to satiation was higher in normoxia than in hypoxia due to the decrease in food intake in the latter. Of the physiological parameters measured, no significant changes were observed in the two species maintained in hypoxia. This study confirms the significant interaction between environmental oxygen concentrations, feeding and growth in fishes. Decrease in food intake could be an indirect mechanism by which prolonged hypoxia reduces growth in turbot and sea bass, and may be a way to reduce energy and thus oxygen demand.},

We demonstrate for the first time that the current levels of temperature variability, particularly seasonal variability, are already large enough to substantially reduce long-term population growth rates. As the climate changes, our results highlight the importance of considering the ecological effects of climate variability and not just average conditions.},

The response of eight fish community indicators to spatio-temporal changes in fishing effort was studied by comparing the rate of change in (i) areas subject to different levels (high, medium, and low) of fishing effort and (ii) areas inside and outside a closed area (the plaice box) where management measures led to changes in fishing effort over time. Several indicators showed broadly consistent responses to fishing effort (slope of the biomass-size spectra, mean weight, and mean maximum length) while a range of biodiversity indices and biomass did not. The response of the indicators to spatio-temporal changes in fishing effort showed that, with the exception of the slope of the biomass-size spectra, none of the indicators reliably detected the effects of spatial management measures at the scales of time and space that were used for these analyses. While some of the size-based indicators we tested did provide evidence for fishing impacts on communities, the response of the indicators to fishing was not straightforward and may have depended on environmental conditions and historic fishing regimes. Therefore, the indicators would provide limited support for assessing the effects of short-term and small-scale management actions and must be applied with caution until we have an improved theoretical understanding of their response to fishing and the environment.},

The method uses a nonlinear random effects model, which explicitly assumes that an individual's growth parameters represent samples from a multivariate population of growth parameters characteristic of a species or population. The method was applied to backcalculated length-at-age data from the tropical emperor, Lethrinus mahsena. Individual growth parameter variability estimates were compared with those derived using the current "standard" method, which characterizes the joint distribution of growth parameter estimates obtained by independently fitting a growth curve to each individual data set. Estimates of mean von Bertalanffy growth parameters from the two methods were similar. However, estimated growth parameter variances were much higher using the standard method. Using the random effects model, the estimated correlation between population mean values of L and K was \textendash 0.52 or \textendash 0.42, depending on the marginal distribution assumed for K. The latter estimate had a 95\% posterior credibility interval of \textendash 0.62 to \textendash 0.17. These represent the first reliable estimate of this correlation and confirm the view that these parameters are negatively correlated in fish populations; however, the absolute correlation value is somewhat lower than has been assumed.},

Although experiments and models have shown a high potential for both genetic and phenotypic change in response to fishing, empirical examples of genetic responses in wild populations are rare. Here, we compare whole-genome sequence data of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) that were collected before (early 20th century) and after (early 21st century) periods of intensive exploitation and rapid decline in the age of maturation from two geographically distinct populations in Newfoundland, Canada, and the northeast Arctic, Norway. Our temporal, genome-wide analyses of 346,290 loci show no substantial loss of genetic diversity and high effective population sizes. Moreover, we do not find distinct signals of strong selective sweeps anywhere in the genome, although we cannot rule out the possibility of highly polygenic evolution. Our observations suggest that phenotypic change in these populations is not constrained by irreversible loss of genomic variation and thus imply that former traits could be reestablished with demographic recovery.},

Both marine and terrestrial fauna have been affected by warming1,2 but an explicit comparison of physiological sensitivity between the marine and terrestrial realms has been lacking. Assessing how close populations live to their upper thermal limits has been challenging, in part because extreme temperatures frequently drive demographic responses3,4 and yet fauna can use local thermal refugia to avoid extremes5\textendash 7. Here we show that marine ectotherms experience hourly body temperatures that are closer to their upper thermal limits than do terrestrial ectotherms across all latitudes\textemdash but that this is the case only if terrestrial species can access thermal refugia. Although not a direct prediction of population decline, this thermal safety margin provides an index of the physiological stress caused by warming. On land, the smallest thermal safety margins were found for species at mid-latitudes where the hottest hourly body temperatures occurred; by contrast, the marine species with the smallest thermal safety margins were found near the equator. We also found that local extirpations related to warming have been twice as common in the ocean as on land, which is consistent with the smaller thermal safety margins at sea. Our results suggest that different processes will exacerbate thermal vulnerability across these two realms. Higher sensitivities to warming and faster rates of colonization in the marine realm suggest that extirpations will be more frequent and species turnover faster in the ocean. By contrast, terrestrial species appear to be more vulnerable to loss of access to thermal refugia, which would make habitat fragmentation and changes in land use critical drivers of species loss on land.},

By examining fisheries in the northeastern United States over the last four decades of warming temperatures, we show that northward shifts in species distributions were matched by corresponding northward shifts in fisheries. The proportion of warm-water species caught in most states also increased through time. Most importantly, however, fisheries shifted only 10\textendash 30~\% as much as their target species, and evidence suggested that economic and regulatory constraints played important roles in creating these lags. These lags may lead to overfishing and population declines if not accounted for in fisheries management and climate adaptation. In coupled natural-human systems such as fisheries, human actions play important roles in determining the sustainability of the system and, therefore, future conservation and climate mitigation planning will need to consider not only biophysical changes, but also human responses to these changes and the feedbacks that these responses have on ecosystems.},

This study assessed the effects of temperature and body weight on the routine metabolic rate (RMR) and postprandial metabolic response in mulloway, Argyrosomus japonicus. RMR and SDA were established at 3 temperatures (14, 20 and 26 \textdegree C). 5 size classes of mulloway ranging from 60 g to 1.14 kg were used to establish RMR with 3 of the 5 size classes (60, 120 and 240 g) used to establish SDA. The effect of body size on the mass-specific RMR (mg O2 kg-1 h-1) varied significantly depending on the temperature; there was a greater relative increase in the mass-specific RMR for smaller mulloway with increasing temperature. No statistical differences were found between the mass exponent (b) values at each temperature when tested against H0: b = 0.8. The gross RMR of mulloway (mg O2 fish-1 h- 1) can be described as function of temperature (T; 14\textendash 26 \textdegree C) as: (0.0195T\textendash 0.0454)BW(g)0.8 and the mass-specific RMR (mg O2 kg-1 h-1) can be described as: (21.042T\textendash 74.867)BW(g)- 0.2. Both SDA duration and time to peak SDA were influenced by temperature and body weight; SDA duration occurred within 41\textendash 89 h and peak time occurred within 17\textendash 38 h of feeding. The effect of body size on peak metabolic rate varied significantly depending on temperature, generally increasing with temperature and decreasing with increasing body size. Peak gross oxygen consumption (MO2: mg O2 fish-1 h- 1) scaled allometrically with BW. Temperature, but not body size, significantly affected SDA scope, although the difference was numerically small. There was a trend for MO2 above RMR over the SDA period to increase with temperature; however, this was not statistically significant. The average proportion of energy expended over the SDA period (SDA coefficient) ranged from approximately 7\textendash 13\% of the total DE intake while the proportion of total energy expended on SDA above RMR ranged from approximately 16\textendash 27\%.},

Quantitative models to support fisheries decision-making may be either strategic (`big picture', direction-setting and contextual) or tactical (focused on management actions on short timescales), with some strategic models informing the development of tactical models. We describe and review `Models of Intermediate Complexity for Ecosystem assessments' (MICE) that have a tactical focus, including use as ecosystem assessment tools. MICE are context- and question-driven and limit complexity by restricting the focus to those components of the ecosystem needed to address the main effects of the management question under consideration. Stakeholder participation and dialogue is an integral part of this process. MICE estimate parameters through fitting to data, use statistical diagnostic tools to evaluate model performance and account for a broad range of uncertainties. These models therefore address many of the impediments to greater use of ecosystem models in strategic and particularly tactical decision-making for marine resource management and conservation. MICE are capable of producing outputs that could be used for tactical decision-making, but our summary of existing models suggests this has not occurred in any meaningful way to date. We use a model of the pelagic ecosystem in the Coral Sea and a linked catchment and ocean model of the Gulf of Carpentaria, Australia, to illustrate how MICE can be constructed. We summarize the major advantages of the approach, indicate opportunities for the development of further applications and identify the major challenges to broad adoption of the approach.},

No fish survived at 10\% saturation and only a few survived at 16\% saturation, whereas no mortality occurred at 34 and 40\% oxygen saturation.

However, temperature (2 and 6\textdegree{} C) had no measurable impact on cod survival. Small (mean \& S.D.; 45{$\cdot$}2 {$\pm$} 4{$\cdot$}2 cm) and large (57{$\cdot$}5 {$\pm$} 3{$\cdot$}8 cm) cod had the same tolerance to hypoxia. At the end of the experiments, hypoxia had a significant effect on blood haematocrit, mean cellular haemoglobin content, liver lactate, plasma glucose and plasma lactate, but accounted for only a small fraction ({$<$} 10\%) of the variation, except for plasma lactate which exhibited a strong response with concentrations increasing progressively with decreasing levels of oxygen saturation. Temperature had a significant effect on most variates in normoxia and hypoxia. Variates also affected by oxygen level showed significant interactions between oxygen and size or temperature effects. However, these interactions accounted for only a small proportion of the variation. Physiological parameters indicated that extending the duration of our tests beyond 96 h would not have changed our estimates of the lethal thresholds. Hypoxic conditions are a permanent feature of the deep waters of the Gulf of St Lawrence. This study shows that a significant portion of the benthic habitats in the Gulf are uninhabitable for cod which would be expected to avoid waters below 28\% oxygen saturation.},

  abstract = {A primary goal of ecology is to understand the fundamental processes underlying the geographic distributions of species. Two major strands of ecology \textendash{} habitat modelling and community ecology \textendash{} approach this problem differently. Habitat modellers often use species distribution models (SDMs) to quantify the relationship between species' and their environments without considering potential biotic interactions. Community ecologists, on the other hand, tend to focus on biotic interactions and, in observational studies, use co-occurrence patterns to identify ecological processes. Here, we describe a joint species distribution model (JSDM) that integrates these distinct observational approaches by incorporating species co-occurrence data into a SDM. JSDMs estimate distributions of multiple species simultaneously and allow decomposition of species co-occurrence patterns into components describing shared environmental responses and residual patterns of co-occurrence. We provide a general description of the model, a tutorial and code for fitting the model in R. We demonstrate this modelling approach using two case studies: frogs and eucalypt trees in Victoria, Australia. Overall, shared environmental correlations were stronger than residual correlations for both frogs and eucalypts, but there were cases of strong residual correlation. Frog species generally had positive residual correlations, possibly due to the fact these species occurred in similar habitats that were not fully described by the environmental variables included in the JSDM. Eucalypt species that interbreed had similar environmental responses but had negative residual co-occurrence. One explanation is that interbreeding species may not form stable assemblages despite having similar environmental affinities. Environmental and residual correlations estimated from JSDMs can help indicate whether co-occurrence is driven by shared environmental responses or other ecological or evolutionary process (e.g. biotic interactions), or if important predictor variables are missing. JSDMs take into account the fact that distributions of species might be related to each other and thus overcome a major limitation of modelling species distributions independently.},

  abstract = {Sea water temperature affects all biological and ecological processes that ultimately impact ecosystem functioning. In this study, we examine the influence of temperature on global biomass transfers from marine secondary production to fish stocks. By combining fisheries catches in all coastal ocean areas and life history traits of exploited marine species, we provide global estimates of two trophic transfer parameters which determine biomass flows in coastal marine food web: the trophic transfer efficiency and the biomass residence time in the food web. We find that biomass transfers in tropical ecosystems are less efficient and faster than in areas with cooler waters. In contrast, biomass transfers through the food web became faster and more efficient between 1950 and 2010. Using simulated changes in sea water temperature from three Earth system models, we project that the mean trophic transfer efficiency in coastal waters would decrease from 7.7\% to 7.2\% between 2010 and 2,100 under the `no effective mitigation' Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP 8.5), while biomass residence time between trophic level 2 and 4 is projected to decrease from 2.7 to 2.3 year on average. Beyond the global trends, we show that the trophic transfer efficiencies and biomass residence times may vary substantially among ecosystem types and that the polar ecosystems may be the most impacted ecosystems. The detected and projected changes in mean trophic transfer efficiency and biomass residence time will undermine food web functioning. Our study provides quantitative understanding of temperature effects on trophodynamic of marine ecosystems under climate change.},

  abstract = {Ongoing climate change is predicted to affect individual organisms during all life stages, thereby affecting populations of a species, communities and the functioning of ecosystems. These effects of climate change can be direct, through changing water temperatures and associated phenologies, the lengths and frequency of hypoxia events, through ongoing ocean acidification trends or through shifts in hydrodynamics and in sea level. In some cases, climate interactions with a species will also, or mostly, be indirect and mediated through direct effects on key prey species which change the composition and dynamic coupling of food webs. Thus, the implications of climate change for marine fish populations can be seen to result from phenomena at four interlinked levels of biological organization: (1) organismal-level physiological changes will occur in response to changing environmental variables such as temperature, dissolved oxygen and ocean carbon dioxide levels. An integrated view of relevant effects, adaptation processes and tolerance limits is provided by the concept of oxygen and capacity-limited thermal tolerance (OCLT). (2) Individual-level behavioural changes may occur such as the avoidance of unfavourable conditions and, if possible, movement into suitable areas. (3) Population-level changes may be observed via changes in the balance between rates of mortality, growth and reproduction. This includes changes in the retention or dispersion of early life stages by ocean currents, which lead to the establishment of new populations in new areas or abandonment of traditional habitats. (4) Ecosystem-level changes in productivity and food web interactions will result from differing physiological responses by organisms at different levels of the food web. The shifts in biogeography and warming-induced biodiversity will affect species productivity and may, thus, explain changes in fisheries economies. This paper tries to establish links between various levels of biological organization by means of addressing the effective physiological principles at the cellular, tissue and whole organism levels.},

  abstract = {The concept of oxygen- and capacity-dependent thermal tolerance in aquatic ectotherms has successfully explained climate-induced effects of rising temperatures on species abundance in the field. Oxygen supply to tissues and the resulting aerobic performance characters thus form a primary link between organismal fitness and its role and functioning at the ecosystem level. The thermal window of performance in water breathers matches their window of aerobic scope. Loss of performance reflects the earliest level of thermal stress, caused by hypoxaemia and the progressive mismatch of oxygen supply and demand at the borders of the thermal envelope. Oxygen deficiency elicits the transition to passive tolerance and associated systemic and cellular stress signals like hormonal responses or oxidative stress as well as the use of protection mechanisms like heat shock proteins at thermal extremes. Thermal acclimatization between seasons or adaptation to a climate regime involves shifting thermal windows and adjusting window widths. The need to specialize on a limited temperature range results from temperature-dependent trade-offs at several hierarchical levels, from molecular structure to whole-organism functioning, and may also support maximized energy efficiency. Various environmental factors like CO(2) (ocean acidification) and hypoxia interact with these principal relationships. Existing knowledge suggests that these factors elicit metabolic depression supporting passive tolerance to thermal extremes. However, they also exacerbate hypoxaemia, causing a narrowing of thermal performance windows and prematurely leading the organism to the limits of its thermal acclimation capacity. The conceptual analysis suggests that the relationships between energy turnover, the capacities of activity and other functions and the width of thermal windows may lead to an integrative understanding of specialization on climate and, as a thermal matrix, of sensitivity to climate change and the factors involved. Such functional relationships might also relate to climate-induced changes in species interactions and, thus, community responses at the ecosystem level.},

This study demonstrates the techniques applicability to small-scale data-poor fisheries and illustrates the type of data required, and the assessment's outputs. A methodology is developed for extending the principles of Beverton\textendash Holt Life History Invariants to use the literature on related species within the Indo-Pacific reef fish assemblage to `borrow' the information needed to parameterize assessments for Palau's poorly studied stocks. While the assessments will continue to be improved through the collection of more size and maturity data, and through further synthesis of the literature, a consistent and coherent picture emerges of a heavily fished assemblage with most assessed species having SPR {$<$} 20\% and many {$<$}10\%. Beyond the technical aspects of this study, the relative simplicity of the data being collected and the underlying concept of spawning potential facilitated the involvement of fishers in collecting their own data and community ownership of the results.},

We define a `generic biphasic' (GB) model that assumes post-maturation growth has a von Bertalanffy (vB) form. For this model we derive an explicit expression for the gonad weight/somatic weight ratio (g) which may either remain fixed or vary with size. Optimal biphasic models are then developed with reproductive strategies that maximise lifetime reproductive output. We consider two optimal growth models. In the first (fixed g optimal), gonad weight is constrained to be proportional to somatic weight. In the second (variable g optimal) model, allocation to reproduction is unconstrained and g increases with size. For the first of these two models, adult growth in a scaled measure of length has the exact vB form. When there are no constraints on allocation, growth is vB to a very good approximation. In both models, pre-maturation growth is linear. In a companion paper we use growth data from lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) to test the bioenergetics assumptions used to develop these models, and demonstrate that they have advantages over the vB model, both in quality of fit, and in the information contained in the fitted parameters.},

Anchovy was found to be more generalist, consuming a higher diversity of prey items. Herring was more specialized, with low diversity of food items. Sprat was intermediate between anchovy and herring. The dietary overlap between anchovy and sprat was highest, followed by herring and sprat before anchovy and herring. The mean weight of stomach contents did not differ between species. We conclude that of the 3 species, anchovy is likely to be the least affected by changing plankton communities.},

Scientific models, such as Newtonian physics or biological gene regulatory networks, are human-driven simplifications of complex phenomena that serve as surrogates for the countless experiments that validated the models. Recently, machine learning has been able to overcome the inaccuracies of approximate modeling by directly learning the entire set of nonlinear interactions from data. However, without any predetermined structure from the scientific basis behind the problem, machine learning approaches are flexible but data-expensive, requiring large databases of homogeneous labeled training data. A central challenge is reconciling data that is at odds with simplified models without requiring "big data". In this work we develop a new methodology, universal differential equations (UDEs), which augments scientific models with machine-learnable structures for scientifically-based learning. We show how UDEs can be utilized to discover previously unknown governing equations, accurately extrapolate beyond the original data, and accelerate model simulation, all in a time and data-efficient manner. This advance is coupled with open-source software that allows for training UDEs which incorporate physical constraints, delayed interactions, implicitly-defined events, and intrinsic stochasticity in the model. Our examples show how a diverse set of computationally-difficult modeling issues across scientific disciplines, from automatically discovering biological mechanisms to accelerating climate simulations by 15,000x, can be handled by training UDEs.},

  abstract = {Salmonid biologists use both mental models\textemdash simple assumptions\textemdash and bioenergetics-based mathematical models to understand and predict effects of temperature regime on growth. Bioenergetics model results, however, sometimes conflict with common assumptions. Previous studies plus ``Wisconsin model'' bioenergetics simulations lead to four conclusions that conflict with some management assumptions. The first conclusion is that food consumption is at least as important as temperature in explaining growth; we cannot understand temperature effects without understanding food consumption. Second, at natural food consumption rates, there is no ``optimal temperature for growth''; growth peaks in model results are artifacts of food consumption assumptions, and growth peaks in laboratory studies are (apparently) artifacts of ad libitum feeding. Third, effects of temperature on growth can be stronger during cooler seasons than in summer; traditional temperature criteria are not useful for managing such effects. Fourth, salmonid populations that are adapted to survive higher temperatures may be more, not less, vulnerable to temperature effects on growth due to their higher metabolic rates. Temperature\textendash growth relations observed under ad libitum feeding seem risky for managing wild populations. Model predictions of growth need to carefully consider assumptions about food consumption. For predicting effects of increased temperature, the traditional assumption that consumption is a constant fraction of maximum consumption rate appears especially uncertain and incautious, with its hidden assumption that consumption increases with temperature; assuming a constant ration is simpler and more cautious. Growth can be predicted more reliably with feeding models and individual-based population models that consider how consumption and energetic costs depend on processes such as habitat selection, competition, and adaptive behaviors involving tradeoffs between food intake and predation risk. Two research needs are clear: empirical observations for parameterizing and testing the Wisconsin model comprehensively under natural conditions (which we lack despite the extensive energetics literature), and methods for predicting salmonid food production responses to temperature and flow regimes.},

The final host of the liver worm is grey seal (Halichoerus grypus), and this parasite is carried to cod via prey, smaller pelagic fish. There is a small-scale cod fishery in the Finnish waters in the Sea of \AA land, where cod are large sized and in good condition. Grey seals are abundant in these waters.   In this study, the occurrence of Contracaecum larvae in the livers of cod in the Sea of \AA land and the food of the cod in the year 2021 was examined and presented together with the results from the year 2020. The size of measured cod in 2021 varied from 40 to 105 cm. Similarly, as in 2020, the number of Contracaecum osculatum larvae on liver surface correlated with cod length, but the number of larvae per liver weight did not. The condition factor of the cod was still very high (1.14). More importantly and similarly as in the previous year, the condition of the cod was associated neither with the number of Contracaecum larvae on the liver surface nor the number of larvae per liver weight. The most common food items of cod were Saduria and clupeid fish. The samples from both years support the conclusion that when there is enough food for the cod, the association of Contracaecum osculatum infection and the condition or growth of cod are small or even insignificant.},

  abstract = {Warming could strongly stabilize or destabilize populations and food webs by changing the interaction strengths between predators and their prey. Predicting the consequences of warming requires understanding how temperature affects ingestion (energy gain) and metabolism (energy loss). Here, we studied the temperature dependence of metabolism and ingestion in laboratory experiments with terrestrial arthropods (beetles and spiders). From this data, we calculated ingestion efficiencies (ingestion/metabolism) and per capita interaction strengths in the short and long term. Additionally, we investigated if and how body mass changes these temperature dependencies. For both predator groups, warming increased metabolic rates substantially, whereas temperature effects on ingestion rates were weak. Accordingly, the ingestion efficiency (the ratio of ingestion to metabolism) decreased in all treatments. This result has two possible consequences: on the one hand, it suggests that warming of natural ecosystems could increase intrinsic population stability, meaning less fluctuations in population density; on the other hand, decreasing ingestion efficiencies may also lead to higher extinction risks because of starvation. Additionally, predicted long-term per capita interaction strengths decreased with warming, which suggests an increase in perturbation stability of populations, i.e., a higher probability of returning to the same equilibrium density after a small perturbation. Together, these results suggest that warming has complex and potentially profound effects on predator\textendash prey interactions and food-web stability.},

Feeding rates, as all biological rates, depend on consumer and resource body masses and environmental temperature. Despite five decades of research on functional responses as quantitative models of feeding rates, a unifying framework of how they scale with body masses and temperature is still lacking. This is perplexing, considering that the strength of functional responses (i.e. interaction strengths) is crucially important for the stability of simple consumer-resource systems and the persistence, sustainability and biodiversity of complex communities. Here, we present the largest currently available database on functional response parameters and their scaling with body mass and temperature. Moreover, these data are integrated across ecosystems and metabolic types of species. Surprisingly, we found general temperature dependencies that differed from the Arrhenius terms predicted by metabolic models. Additionally, the body-mass-scaling relationships were more complex than expected and differed across ecosystems and metabolic types. At local scales (taxonomically narrow groups of consumer-resource pairs), we found hump-shaped deviations from the temperature and body-mass-scaling relationships. Despite the complexity of our results, these body-mass- and temperature-scaling models remain useful as a mechanistic basis for predicting the consequences of warming for interaction strengths, population dynamics and network stability across communities differing in their size structure.},

We estimated abundances of hatchery and wild smolts during 1975-1990 for both lakes based on stocking rates, survival schedules, and discrimination of the proportion of the lake population that was naturally recruited. Recruitment of wild steelhead varied as a function of presmolt winter severity in both lakes. Wild smolts accounted for 6-44\% (during 1982-1989) and 18-33\% (during 1978-1985) of total annual smolt production in Lakes Michigan and Ontario, respectively. We developed an age-structured population model with separate accounting for run timing (summer, fall, and spring) using the proportions of life history stages observed at weirs and estimated adult survival rates. We summarized data on growth, diet, water temperature, and energy contents of predator and prey to model lakewide prey consumption in both lakes during 1975-1990. Lakewide prey consumption by steelhead amounted to 9,500 tonnes-year ! in 1987 in Lake Michigan and 2.200 tonnes-year ! in 1990 in Lake Ontario. Because of their limited dietary reliance on alewife Alosa pseudoharengus and rainbow smelt Osmerus mordax and relatively low stocking density compared with other salmonines, steelhead consumed only 4\% of available alewife production and 2\% of total smelt production in 1987 in Lake Michigan. Although estimates of alewife production in Lake Ontario are presently unavailable, measures of alewife biomass in 1990in Lake Ontario indicate that steelhead probably had a negligible effect on these prey fish. Steelhead consumed only 2\% of total rainbow smelt production in Lake Ontario in 1990. Population biomass conversion efficiency (16.1\%) and production-to-biomass ratio (mean, 1.18) for Lake Michigan steelhead are low compared with those of sympatric Oncorhynchus species. Sensitivity analysis of the population submodel indicated that the most sensitive parameters were lake survival and size at stocking.},

Understanding how these variations in ocean temperature affect processes such as metabolism and energy consumption is important for many species, and may be particularly important for sedentary species that cannot make large-scale movements in response to changes in environmental conditions. We examined how metabolic rates and energetic demands responded to temperature in a temperate reef fish, the bluebanded goby (Lythrypnus dalli). Using respirometry, we estimated resting oxygen consumption (VO2) for 42 L. dalli individuals of varying sizes and calculated metabolic rates (MR) at three different temperatures (13 \textdegree C, 16 \textdegree C, and 20 \textdegree C). As predicted, VO2 and MR increased significantly with temperature and mass, but the rate of temperature-dependent increase in metabolism indicated a very high degree of thermal sensitivity for L. dalli (Q10 value for VO2 was 5.21 across the range of experimental temperatures). The mass-scaling exponent (b) was estimated to be 0.95 and aligned closely with other benthic species. Our results suggest that changes in temperature \textendash{} especially those that occur over weeks and seasons \textendash{} likely play a significant role in the ecology of these gobies. Long-term increases in seawater temperature will either necessitate an increase in foraging and consumption, or drive costly trade-offs between metabolism and processes such as growth and reproduction.},

Using a 12 year time series obtained by a summer survey in the western Baltic Sea, at least three distinct demersal fish species assemblages were identified. Their spatial distribution was relatively stable over time and could be linked to environmental gradients. The demersal fish assemblages were dominated by few species and differed primarily in the percentage of common species. Both, the demersal and the flatfish assemblage were structured according to different habitat preferences. While there were species-specific differences, boosted regression tree modelling (BRT) showed that interannual fluctuations explained a large percentage of the variance in flatfish abundance whereby salinity, water temperature and sediment type were identified as the most important abiotic drivers. Dab was mainly influenced by sediment type and high salinity, while for flounder the main driver was water temperature. Plaice was also impacted by salinity, but was primarily influenced by biotic variables. The availability of benthic prey organisms in the area was verified as biotic driver for flatfish, especially for plaice. The results underline the importance of accounting for fine scale spatial heterogeneity in marine spatial planning in the Baltic Sea and comparable brackish water ecosystems and highlight the importance of considering benthic prey availability and diet analyses in demersal fish monitoring programs.},

Stable stock assessment metrics suggested recovery potential, given appropriate fisheries management measures. However, changing environmental conditions violate stability assumptions, may negatively affect WBC, and challenge the resource management. The present study explored 42 years of changes in WBC biological parameters. WBC body condition gradually decreased over the last decades for juveniles and adults, with a rapid decrease in recent years when a single cohort dominated the overfished stock. The hepato-somatic index and the muscle weight decreased by 50\% and 10\% in the last 10 years, respectively, suggesting severely decreasing energy reserves and productivity. The changes in energy reserves were associated with changes in environmental conditions (increase in bottom water temperature, expansion of hypoxic areas during late summer/autumn), and changes in diet composition (less herring). A key bottleneck is the warming and longer-lasting summer period when WBC, trapped between warmed shallow waters and hypoxic deeper waters, have to mobilize energy reserves to account for reduced feeding opportunities and thermal stress. Our results suggest that stock recovery is unlikely to happen by fisheries management alone if environmental trajectories remain unchanged.},

He suggested that the solution using the metabolic scaling exponent a = 2/3 (Von Bertalanffy growth function VBGF) would be universal for vertebrates. Several authors questioned universality, as for certain species other models would provide a better fit. This paper reconsiders this question. Based on 60 data sets from literature (37 about fish and 23 about non-fish species) it optimizes the model parameters, in particular the exponent 0 {$\leq$} a {$<$} 1, so that the model curve achieves the best fit to the data. The main observation of the paper is the large variability in the exponent, which can vary over a very large range without affecting the fit to the data significantly, when the other parameters are also optimized. The paper explains this by differences in the data quality: variability is low for data from highly controlled experiments and high for natural data. Other deficiencies were biologically meaningless optimal parameter values or optimal parameter values attained on the boundary of the parameter region (indicating the possible need for a different model). Only 11 of the 60 data sets were free of such deficiencies and for them no universal exponent could be discerned.},

We evaluated this mechanism as an explanation for SSD in two North American percid species\textendash walleye Sander vitreus and yellow perch Perca flavescens. 2. Data from 47 walleye and 67 yellow perch populations indicated that SSD is associated with the onset of maturation: typically, males of both species matured smaller and earlier and attained a smaller asymptotic size than females. Males also demonstrated equal (perch) or longer (walleye) reproductive life spans compared with females. 3. To examine whether reduced post-maturation growth in males was due to lower energy acquisition or higher reproductive costs we applied a contaminant mass-balance model combined with a bioenergetics model to estimate metabolic costs and food consumption of each sex. Mature males exhibited lower food consumption, metabolic costs and food conversion efficiencies compared with females. 4. We propose that slower growth in males at the onset of maturity is a result of decreased feeding activity to reduce predation risk. Our finding that SSD in percids is associated with the onset of maturity is supported by laboratory-based observations reported elsewhere, showing that changes in growth rate, consumption and food conversion efficiency were elicited by oestrogen (positive effects) or androgen (negative effects) exposure in P. flavescens and P. fluviatilis. 5. Researchers applying bioenergetic models for comparative studies across populations should use caution in applying bioenergetic models in the absence of information on population sex ratio and potential differences between the sexes in energetic parameters.},

The ramifications of temperature for ecological communities include not only its direct effects on the physiology of individuals, but also how these effects play out in the context of other processes such as competition. Apparently idiosyncratic or difficult to predict effects of temperature on competitive outcomes are well represented in the literature. General theoretical understanding of how physiological influences of temperature filter through community dynamics to determine outcomes is limited. We present a theoretical framework for predicting the effects of temperature on competition among species, based on understanding the effects of temperature on the physiological and population parameters of the species. The approach helps unify formal resource competition theory with metabolic and physiological ecology. Phytoplankton and many other ectotherms are smaller at higher temperatures. This has been observed experimentally, across geographical gradients, and as change accompanying climate warming, but it has not been explained in terms of competition. As a case study, we apply our theoretical framework to competition for nutrients among differently sized phytoplankton. Based on this analysis, we hypothesize that the prevalence of smaller phytoplankton at higher temperatures is at least partly due to an accentuated competitive advantage of smaller cells at higher temperatures with respect to nutrient uptake and growth. We examine the scope for extending the approach to understand resource competition, generally, among ectotherms of different sizes.},

Species-based and community-wide estimates of preferred and realized predator\textendash prey mass ratios (PPMR) are required inputs to size-based size spectrum models of marine communities, food webs, and ecosystems. Here, we clarify differences between PPMR definitions in different size spectrum models, in particular differences between PPMR measurements weighting prey abundance in individual predators by biomass (rbio) and numbers (rnum). We argue that the former weighting generates PPMR as usually conceptualized in equilibrium (static) size spectrum models while the latter usually applies to dynamic models. We use diet information from 170,689 individuals of 34 species of fish in Alaskan marine ecosystems to calculate both PPMR metrics. Using hierarchical models, we examine how explained variance in these metrics changed with predator body size, predator taxonomic resolution, and spatial resolution. In the hierarchical analysis, variance in both metrics emerged primarily at the species level and substantially less variance was associated with other (higher) taxonomic levels or with spatial resolution. This suggests that changes in species composition are the main drivers of community-wide mean PPMR. At all levels of analysis, relationships between weighted mean rbio or weighted mean rnum and predator mass tended to be dome-shaped. Weighted mean rnum values, for species and community-wide, were approximately an order of magnitude higher than weighted mean rbio, reflecting the consistent numeric dominance of small prey in predator diets. As well as increasing understanding of the drivers of variation in PPMR and providing estimates of PPMR in the north Pacific Ocean, our results demonstrate that that rbio or rnum, as well as their corresponding weighted means for any defined group of predators, are not directly substitutable. When developing equilibrium size-based models based on bulk energy flux or comparing PPMR estimates derived from the relationship between body mass and trophic level with those based on diet analysis, weighted mean rbio is a more appropriate measure of PPMR. When calibrating preference PPMR in dynamic size spectrum models then weighted mean rnum will be a more appropriate measure of PPMR.},

In addition, policy and restoration measures mandated to conform to ecosystem-based management principals can benefit from information on temporal and spatial variability in community-level interactions. Here, we analyzed guild structure of the demersal fish assemblage in Puget Sound, WA, a temperate estuarine system on the US west coast. Using diet information from 2,401 stomachs collected across three seasons (fall, winter, and summer), we identified guild membership for 21 fish species, examined seasonal guild switching, and tested for seasonal shifts in predation and for differences in the degree of diet overlap at the assemblage level. We accounted for ontogenetic variation in diet by dividing species into large (L) and small (S) size classes when appropriate. Using cluster analysis and a permutation approach, we identified seven significant guilds that were typified by predation on benthic invertebrates, pelagic invertebrates, and piscivory. Of the 18 species with more than one season of diet information, six switched guilds (Pacific sanddab L, sturgeon poacher, Pacific tomcod S, speckled sanddab, rex sole, and rock sole S). At the assemblage level, we tested for seasonal differences in prey use between seasons by performing an analysis of similarities based on Bray\textendash Curtis diet similarities and found no significant difference. However, diet overlap was significantly higher in the summer than the fall and winter (with summer\,{$>$}\,fall\,{$>$}\,winter) indicating that diets within the assemblage converged in the summer. These results indicate that analyses of guild structure and diet overlap can reveal seasonal variation in community trophic structure and highlight intra-annual food web variation in the Puget Sound demersal fish community.},

  abstract = {The four general components of an ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF) are reviewed. In taking account of environment forcing in stock dynamics, arguments are presented that effects of environmental forcing on growth, maturation and natural mortality are often more important to management than effects on recruitment. In holding fisheries accountable for the ecosystem effects of fishing, it is argued that direct effects of fishing are generally known and can be managed. However, interactions among fisheries and between fisheries and other sectors pose difficult challenges to equitable decisions in managing these impacts, and many traditional incentives function differently in EAF than in target-stock management. Achieving inclusiveness in decision-making and stewardship is also made more complex in EAF, because of the much larger number of interests with a legitimate role in decision-making. As a result, integrated management (IM) becomes a necessary component of EAF, although EAF and IM are not interchangeable concepts. The treatment of all four components of an EAF considers the need for a balanced and stable outcome on all three dimensions of sustainability \textendash{} ecological, economic and social. It also highlights that different participant groups in governance display different risk tolerances for misses (not taking conservation action when needed) and false alarms (restraining access to social or economic benefits when little ecological benefit results). These differences in tolerances for different kinds of management errors often complicate decision-making an EAF setting and raise transaction costs greatly.},

(2001) describe a general model of ontogenetic growth in which growth represents the surplus of energy acquisition over maintenance energy requirement, which themselves are allometric (power) functions of body mass with exponents 3/4 and 1, respectively. Furthermore, the intercept of the maintenance requirement decreases with the \textendash 1/4 power of adult mass. 2 These relationships determine the sigmoid shape of the postnatal growth curve and the 3/4 allometric slope of time to complete growth as a function of adult mass. 3 West et al.'s growth function is a particular form of the generalized P\"utter growth model dm/dt = amy - bmz, which includes other familiar growth functions, such as the logistic and von Bertalanffy equations. 4 Empirical estimates of the allometry of resting metabolism in growing birds are close to z = 1 in some precocial species, but are approximately 50\% higher in altricial and semiprecocial birds, which challenges the generality of any single growth function for birds. 5 Rather than growth rate being limited by the difference between energy acquisition and maintenance expenditure, it may also be determined by the growth potential of tissues, which is traded off against functional capacity. Predicted growth curves based on increasing tissue function with age are indistinguishable from the West et al. and related equations. 6 Models based on growth rate\textendash functional maturity trade-offs also can produce observed allometric relationships of growth rate to adult mass by incorporating the relative size of the chick at hatching. 7 In contrast to West et al.'s model, declining variance in size among individuals as chicks approach adult size implies targeted growth and control of growth rate by feedbacks of body size itself on growth rate. 8 The existence of plausible alternative hypotheses for the control of postnatal growth should stimulate additional experimental studies to elucidate mechanisms of growth rate regulation and to understand the evolutionary diversification of postnatal growth.},

Higher temperatures result in smaller body sizes and associated decreases in metabolic rates, and it remains unknown whether this indirect effect of temperature increase could mitigate the direct positive effect of temperature on metabolic rate. Here, we assess whether temperature-induced shifts in body size are likely to offset the direct influence of temperature on metabolic rate. Location Global. Time period 1940\textendash 2011. Major taxa studied Ectotherms. Methods We compiled literature-derived data on mass and temperature for 109 ectotherm species raised at various constant temperatures. Using an allometric equation to estimate metabolic rate from size and temperature, we determined the body masses necessary for species to maintain constant metabolic rates under increased temperatures. We also calculated and compared (a) change in metabolic rate attributable to increased temperature where body size does not change with (b) change in metabolic rate including empirical size change. Results Warmer temperatures resulted in increased metabolic rate estimates, but this was partly offset by decreased body sizes for the majority of species. For most species, observed decreases in body size at higher temperatures were insufficient to avoid metabolic rate increases. Main conclusions Although the indirect effect of temperature on metabolic rate via body size is not sufficient to counterbalance the direct effect, it limits the magnitude of the increase in metabolic rate. Thus, in a warming climate, ectotherms are likely to experience increases in energy use that are smaller than anticipated. Given that metabolic rates have substantial, diverse impacts on individuals, populations, and ecosystems, these indirect effects of temperature change will have complex cascading effects on ecological communities, but the impacts of increases in metabolic rate of these varying magnitudes are unknown.},

While there are many single-species studies and integrative reviews documenting this pattern, a data-intensive approach has not been used yet to determine the generality of this pattern. We assessed the strength and direction of the intraspecific relationship between temperature and individual mass for 952 bird and mammal species. For eighty-seven percent of species, temperature explained less than 10\% of variation in mass, and for 79\% of species the correlation was not statistically significant. These results suggest that Bergmann's rule is not general and temperature is not a dominant driver of biogeographic variation in mass. Further understanding of size variation will require integrating multiple processes that influence size. The lack of dominant temperature forcing weakens the justification for the hypothesis that global warming could result in widespread decreases in body size.},

At the beginning of the spawning period mature males and females had equal dry weights of lipid that were 70\% higher than in immatures. Protein content in mature males was equal to that in immatures but was 23 \% higher in mature females. Immature males and females did not differ in chemical composition. At the end of the spawning period, spent and immature fish had equal lipid contents, but protein content in spent females was 10\% lower than in spent males, and 17\% lower than in immatures. Gross energy content of the body decreased by 44\% (65{$\cdot$}2 to 36{$\cdot$}3 J cm-3) in mature females, 27\% (55{$\cdot$}0 to 40{$\cdot$}OJ cm-3) in mature males, and 9\% (48{$\cdot$}7 to 44{$\cdot$}2J cm-3) in immatures. Energy content of plaice eggs was estimated at 6{$\cdot$}60 kJ per 1000 eggs. Reproductive investment was estimated from the energy loss during the spawning period and included the energy of sex products and spawning metabolism. Somatic growth comprised the annual increase in energy content of fish. The pattern of energy allocation over reproduction and somatic growth differed between males and females. Males started their reproduction at a smaller length and a younger age and allocated a higher proportion of the available energy into reproduction than females. Available energy resources for somatic growth and reproduction (surplus production) were equal between the sexes up to a length of about 30 cm. Beyond this length male surplus production levelled off whereas female surplus production continued to increase. The differences in surplus production and the allocation patterns are discussed. For female plaice the energy allocated into egg production was estimated as between 48 and 64\% of the total amount of energy lost during spawning. The remaining energy is used for metabolism during the spawning period, yielding an estimate of the metabolic rate of mature females of between 6{$\cdot$}4 and 9{$\cdot$}1 kJ day-1. A maximum estimate of the metabolic rate of mature males was 7{$\cdot$}4 kJ day-1.},

  abstract = {Coral reefs face a diverse array of threats, from eutrophication and overfishing to climate change. As live corals are lost and their skeletons eroded, the structural complexity of reefs declines. This may have important consequences for the survival and growth of reef fish because complex habitats mediate predator-prey interactions [1, 2] and influence competition [3, 4, 5] through the provision of prey refugia. A positive correlation exists between structural complexity and reef fish abundance and diversity in both temperate and tropical ecosystems [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. However, it is not clear how the diversity of available refugia interacts with individual predator-prey relationships to explain emergent properties at the community scale. Furthermore, we do not yet have the ability to predict how habitat loss might affect the productivity of whole reef communities and the fisheries they support. Using data from an unfished reserve in The Bahamas, we find that structural complexity is associated not only with increased fish biomass and abundance, but also with nonlinearities in the size spectra of fish, implying disproportionately high abundances of certain size classes. By developing a size spectrum food web model that links the~vulnerability of prey to predation with the structural complexity of a reef, we show that these nonlinearities can be explained by size-structured prey refugia that reduce mortality rates and alter growth rates in different parts of the size spectrum. Fitting the model with data from a structurally complex habitat, we predict that a loss of complexity could cause more than a 3-fold reduction in fishery productivity. Video Abstract},

Here, we combine simulation modelling with analysis of published data on thermal acclimation and breadth (range of temperatures over which organisms perform well) to develop a framework for predicting thermal plasticity across taxa, latitudes, body sizes, traits, habitats and methodological factors. Our synthesis includes {$>$} 2000 measures of acclimation capacities from {$>$} 500 species of ectotherms spanning fungi, invertebrates, and vertebrates from freshwater, marine and terrestrial habitats. We find that body size, latitude, and methodological factors often interact to shape acclimation responses and that acclimation rate scales negatively with body size, contributing to a general negative association between body size and thermal breadth across species. Additionally, we reveal that acclimation capacity increases with body size, increases with latitude (to mid-latitudinal zones) and seasonality for smaller but not larger organisms, decreases with thermal safety margin (upper lethal temperature minus maximum environmental temperatures), and is regularly underestimated because of experimental artefacts. We then demonstrate that our framework can predict the contribution of acclimation plasticity to the IUCN threat status of amphibians globally, suggesting that phenotypic plasticity is already buffering some species from climate change.},

Consequently, interpreting individual variation in metabolism requires a sound understanding of the potentially confounding role of growth and the relative importance of fixed (genetic) vs. environmental drivers of SMR variation. We review the role of growth in measured SMR variation in juvenile salmonids, with the goals of (i) understanding the contribution of growth (and food consumption) to SMR variation through ontogeny, (ii) understanding the relative contributions of tissue maintenance and biosynthesis (overhead costs of growth) to apparent SMR variation, and (iii) using intrinsic growth effects on SMR to model how alternate life-history strategies may influence growth and measured SMR in juvenile salmonids. SMR measures on juveniles, even when post-absorptive, may be inflated by delayed growth-associated overhead costs, unless juveniles are on a maintenance ration (i.e. not growing). Empirical measurements of apparent SMR in food restricted vs. satiated 2\textendash 5 g juvenile salmon demonstrate that estimates may be inflated by as much as 67\% due to delayed overhead costs of growth, even when SMR measurements are taken 35 h post-feeding. These results indicate that a substantial component of variation in apparent SMR among juvenile salmonids may be associated with (i) environmentally driven variation in ration (where elevated SMR measurements are an artefact of delayed growth overhead costs), (ii) intrinsic (genetic) or plastic organ-system trade-offs related to increasing investment in metabolically expensive digestive tissue responsible for processing food and (iii) intrinsic (genetic) variation in maximum body size and growth among individuals or life-history types. We suggest that selection for differences in adult body size among resident and anadromous forms leading to differences in juvenile growth trajectories may contribute to both SMR variation and habitat segregation in freshwater, where juveniles with higher growth are constrained to foraging in high velocity habitats to meet their greater consumption needs.},

Current approaches for multispecies occupancy modelling are practically limited to two interacting species and often require the assumption of asymmetric interactions. We propose a multispecies occupancy model that can accommodate two or more interacting species. We generalize the single-species occupancy model to two or more interacting species by assuming the latent occupancy state is a multivariate Bernoulli random variable. We propose modelling the probability of each potential latent occupancy state with both a multinomial logit and a multinomial probit model and present details of a Gibbs sampler for the latter. As an example, we model co-occurrence probabilities of bobcat (Lynx rufus), coyote (Canis latrans), grey fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) and red fox (Vulpes vulpes) as a function of human disturbance variables throughout 6 Mid-Atlantic states in the eastern United States. We found evidence for pairwise interactions among most species, and the probability of some pairs of species occupying the same site varied along environmental gradients; for example, occupancy probabilities of coyote and grey fox were independent at sites with little human disturbance, but these two species were more likely to occur together at sites with high human disturbance. Ecological communities are composed of multiple interacting species. Our proposed method improves our ability to draw inference from such communities by permitting modelling of detection/non-detection data from an arbitrary number of species, without assuming asymmetric interactions. Additionally, our proposed method permits modelling the probability two or more species occur together as a function of environmental variables. These advancements represent an important improvement in our ability to draw community-level inference from multiple interacting species that are subject to imperfect detection.},

Using a 137Cs mass balance approach, we estimated the annual bioenergetic budgets for individual age-classes of 19 species of North American freshwater fish. Immature fish have low activity-related metabolic costs that agree with estimates based on swimming speed or integer multipliers. Mature fish have 2- to 4-fold higher activity than immature fish and 2- to 4-fold higher activity than estimates based on swimming speed or integer multipliers. The higher activity in mature fish may be due to reproductive efforts. Underestimation of activity in conventional bioenergetics models leads to underestimation of consumption rates. Thus, our in situ and age-specific estimates of activity costs provide a means to improve bioenergetic predictions. Although our analysis was done on an annual basis, it is possible to use the 137Cs technique over shorter intervals (weeks). The 137Cs method has general applicability to aquatic systems because 137Cs is globally dispersed and can be accurately measured in all aquatic organisms using gamma spectrometry.},

The Biotest is a man-made enclosure within the Baltic Sea that has received warm water from a nuclear power plant since 1980, resulting in temperatures that are elevated 5-10 degrees C relative to the surrounding Baltic Sea. Sampled fish ranged from young-of-the-year to 14 years. Geometric morphometrics and multivariate statistical analysis revealed significant morphological differences between individuals of P. fluviatilis from these two habitats. Most importantly, relative shape changed with size, with small individuals of P. fluviatilis from Biotest being characterized by a deeper body shape and a larger caudal peduncle than the smaller Baltic individuals. In large specimens, smaller differences were found with Biotest individuals being more slender than Baltic individuals. These results show that, in order to have a full understanding of the biological effects of elevated temperatures, studies that cover the entire size range of organisms will be important. Apart from the direct influence of temperature on growth rate and body shape, other ecological factors affected by temperature are discussed as possible contributors to the observed differences between the two populations.},

  abstract = {Both oxygen and temperature are fundamental factors determining metabolic performance, fitness, ecological niches, and responses of many aquatic organisms to climate change. Despite the importance of physical and physiological constraints on oxygen supply affecting aerobic metabolism of aquatic ectotherms, ecological theories such as the metabolic theory of ecology have focused on the effects of temperature rather than oxygen. This gap currently impedes mechanistic models from accurately predicting metabolic rates (i.e., oxygen consumption rates) of aquatic organisms and restricts predictions to resting metabolism, which is less affected by oxygen limitation. Here, we expand on models of metabolic scaling by accounting for the role of oxygen availability and temperature on both resting and active metabolic rates. Our model predicts that oxygen limitation is more likely to constrain metabolism in larger, warmer, and active fish. Consequently, active metabolic rates are less responsive to temperature than are resting metabolic rates, and metabolism scales to body size with a smaller exponent whenever temperatures or activity levels are higher. Results from a metaanalysis of fish metabolic rates are consistent with our model predictions. The observed interactive effects of temperature, oxygen availability, and body size predict that global warming will limit the aerobic scope of aquatic ectotherms and may place a greater metabolic burden on larger individuals, impairing their physiological performance in the future. Our model reconciles the metabolic theory with empirical observations of oxygen limitation and provides a formal, quantitative framework for predicting both resting and active metabolic rate and hence aerobic scope of aquatic ectotherms.},

Dolphinfish diets included exocoetids, portunids, and conspecifics as important prey. Blue marlins and wahoos consumed relatively few prey species (i.e., low dietary niche width), while dolphinfish had the highest dietary niche width; yellowfin tuna had intermediate niche width values. Maximum prey size increased with dolphinfish size; however, the consumption of small prey associated with algae Sargassum spp. occurred across the full size range of dolphinfish examined. Most interspecific diet overlap values with dolphinfish were not significant; however, blue marlins, yellowfin tuna, and wahoos had significant diet overlap due to their reliance on scombrid prey. Prey types found in blue marlins, dolphinfish, and wahoos were more consistent among BRT years than prey found in yellowfin tuna. The prey of yellowfin tuna and wahoos collected during BRT years correlated with historic (early 1980s) diet data from North Carolina, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Bahamas. Based on principal components analysis, diets from several oceans clustered together for blue marlins, dolphinfish, yellowfin tuna, and wahoos. Although differences were found, the diets of each predator were largely consistent both temporally (e.g., over the past three decades in the Gulf Stream) and spatially (among oceans), despite potential effects of fishing or environmental changes.},

Central to previous stability analysis has been the assumption that the resources of a consumer are substitutable. However, during their development, most species change diets; for instance, adults often use different resources than larvae or juveniles. Here, we show that such ontogenetic niche shifts are common in real ecological networks and that consideration of these shifts can alter which species are predicted to be at risk of extinction. Furthermore, niche shifts reduce and can even reverse the otherwise stabilizing effect of complexity. This pattern arises because species with several specialized life stages appear to be generalists at the species level but act as sequential specialists that are hypersensitive to resource loss. These results suggest that natural communities are more vulnerable to biodiversity loss than indicated by previous analyses.},

It includes, among others, (generalized) linear models, (generalized) additive models, smoothing spline models, state space models, semiparametric regression, spatial and spatiotemporal models, log-Gaussian Cox processes and geostatistical and geoadditive models. We consider approximate Bayesian inference in a popular subset of structured additive regression models, latent Gaussian models, where the latent field is Gaussian, controlled by a few hyperparameters and with non-Gaussian response variables. The posterior marginals are not available in closed form owing to the non-Gaussian response variables. For such models, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods can be implemented, but they are not without problems, in terms of both convergence and computational time. In some practical applications, the extent of these problems is such that Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling is simply not an appropriate tool for routine analysis. We show that, by using an integrated nested Laplace approximation and its simplified version, we can directly compute very accurate approximations to the posterior marginals. The main benefit of these approximations is computational: where Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms need hours or days to run, our approximations provide more precise estimates in seconds or minutes. Another advantage with our approach is its generality, which makes it possible to perform Bayesian analysis in an automatic, streamlined way, and to compute model comparison criteria and various predictive measures so that models can be compared and the model under study can be challenged.},

  abstract = {Monitoring and assessment of natural resources often require inputs from multiple data sources. In fisheries science, for example, the inference of a species' abundance distribution relies on two main data sources, namely commercial fisheries and scientific survey data. Despite efforts to combine these data into an integrated statistical model, their coupling is frequently hampered due to differences in their sampling designs, which imposes distinct bias sources in the estimator of the abundance distribution. We developed a flexible species distribution model (SDM) that can integrate both data sources while filtering out their relative bias contributions. We applied the model on three different age groups of the western Baltic cod stock. For each age group, we tested the model on (1) survey data and (2) integrated data (survey + commercial) as a means to compare their differences and investigate how the inclusion of commercial fisheries data improved the spatiotemporal abundance estimator and parameter estimates. Moreover, we proposed a novel validation approach to evaluate whether the inclusion of commercial fisheries data in the integrated model is not in direct contradiction with the survey data. Following our approach, the results indicated that the use of commercial fisheries data is suitable for the integrated model. Across all age groups, our results demonstrated how commercial fisheries supplied additional information on cod's spatiotemporal abundance dynamics, highlighting sometimes abundance hot spots that were not detected by the survey model alone. Additionally, the integrated model provided a reduction of up to 20\% and 10\% in the uncertainty (SE) of the predicted abundance fields and fixed-effect parameters, respectively. The proposed model represents thus a valuable benchmark for evaluating spatiotemporal dynamics of fish, and strengthens the science-based advice for marine policymakers.},

The existence of genetically and phenotypically diverse stocks in this region despite intense seasonal mixing strongly implicates natal homing in this species. Based on information from genetic markers and otolith morphology, we estimate the proportional contribution by NS, Skagerrak (SKG) and Kattegat and western Baltic (WBS) fish to mixed aggregations targeted by the NS fishery. We use these estimates to identify spatial and temporal differences in life history (migratory behaviour) and habitat use among genetically differentiated migratory populations that mix seasonally. Our study suggests the existence of more complex patterns of intraspecific diversity than was previously recognized. Sustainability may be compromised if such complex patterns are reduced through generalized management (e.g. area closures) that overlooks population differences in spatial use throughout the life cycle.},

ANOVA and the Kruskal\-Wallis test were used, respectively, to evaluate differences in niche breadth and overlap between areas. The data indicate that the majority of the fish species belong to the piscivore, omnivore, and detritivore guilds. These species have likely colonized the environments due to the availability of suitable feeding resources, and the favorable physical conditions created by the river damming. Overall, few species have ample niches, but most of them are highly specialized. Resources seasonal variation had little effect on the feeding behavior of most species in the study areas. The null models indicated that competition was not a factor determining on community structure.},

Visual censuses were carried out at monthly intervals during 3 years (1992\textendash 1995). Comparison of the fish assemblages 2 years after deployment indicated differences associated with reef and control habitats. D. annularis, D. vulgaris , Chromis chromis , and Apogon imberbis were the species most responsible for assemblage differences. Gut contents of individual D. annularis collected from the two habitats indicated a different diet, especially for larger fish. Although similar prey were eaten, relative abundance of the different items varied. Apparently, habitat differences contributed to differences in dietary patterns and to the diversity and abundance of fish assemblages.

Yet, the time course and mechanisms of this process is little understood. Acclimation dynamics of SMR, maximum metabolic rate, AS and the specific dynamic action of feeding (SDA) were determined in shorthorn sculpin (Myoxocephalus scorpius) after transfer from 10 degrees C to 16 degrees C. SMR increased in the first week by 82\% reducing AS to 55\% of initial values, while peak postprandial metabolism was initially greater. This meant that the estimated AS during peak SDA approached zero, constraining digestion and leaving little room for additional aerobic processes. After eight weeks at 16 degrees C, SMR was restored, while AS and the estimated AS during peak SDA recovered partly. Collectively, this demonstrated a considerable capacity for metabolic thermal compensation, which should be better incorporated into future models on organismal responses to climate change. A mathematical model based on the empirical data suggested that phenotypes with fast acclimation rates may be favoured by natural selection as the accumulated energetic cost of a slow acclimation rate increases in a warmer future with exacerbated thermal variations.},

Community dynamics and climate variation were also tested as potential causes. 3 Temperature was shown to have a positive impact on condition at both inter- and intra-annual timescales. Interannually, temperature may affect stock distribution, in particular its overlap with the capelin stock. At shorter timescales it is likely that temperature directly affects the metabolism of the cod. 4 Intra-annually, the quantity of capelin in cod stomachs positively affected cod condition in the current and the preceding month for all lengths of cod. This indicated a time lag between a change in food consumption and a subsequent change in condition, or `latency'. 5 Our study has shown that variation in temperature is a vital determinant of changes in condition, both at inter- and intra-annual timescales. Furthermore, the principle of latency has been demonstrated at the population level. Indirect effects of competition for energy-rich resources have been shown to have a negative effect on condition. This study supplements our knowledge of the implications for condition of changes in climate and in potential food resources.},

  abstract = {The first attempts to monitor coastal fish in Sweden were made in the 1960s and 1970s. Ecological, physiological, biochemical and environmental chemistry data were collected in separate projects. When the National Marine Monitoring Programme was revised in 1992, a new strategy was introduced for assessments of long-term trends in coastal fish communities. Annual integrated monitoring of contaminants, biomarkers and population and community indicators of ecosystem health was started in selected areas using common sentinel species. Data from one monitoring area at the coast of the Baltic proper are analyzed in this paper. The results have shown a shift in fish community structure indicating changes in ecosystem productivity. Trends have been detected in growth rate (positive) and relative gonad size (negative) in perch (Perca fluviatilis), suggesting a metabolic disturbance according to the predictive response model developed for interpretations. One factor which may have contributed to the reduced GSI was a decrease in mean age of sampled fish during the period of study. Chemical exposure was indicated by a 3-fold increase of EROD activity during the monitored 15-year period. However, concentrations of most measured contaminants in perch have decreased during the same period. The experience of the integrated approach has shown that a tentative analysis of cause and environmental significance could be made, improving the assessment, but there still remain unsolved questions to be answered in follow-up studies. The analysis has also shown the importance of long-term monitoring at several levels of biological organization to distinguish between natural variation and low-level effects on ecosystems.},

We used dynamic factor analysis to reveal common trends in abundance among juvenile demersal marine fishes, and to identify potential environmental drivers. Our results revealed synchronous changes in juvenile fish abundance among the 12 marine species examined in the study. This strong temporal coherence was likely related to the influence of climate and environmental factors, notably sea bottom temperature and the East Atlantic Pattern. We also found some support for alternative drivers of early-life fish dynamics, namely the North Atlantic Oscillation and sea surface chlorophyll-a concentration, the later suggesting bottom-up trophic control. In the context of ongoing environmental changes, our findings raise questions about the future stability of the demersal marine fish community in the Bay of Biscay.},

One of the most examined is Bergmann's rule, which states that body size increases with decreasing temperature and increasing latitude, although the rule is not universal and the proposed mechanisms underpinning it are multifarious and lack congruence. This study considers the degree to which Bergmann's rule applies to the Southern Ocean mesopelagic fish community. We studied patterns in body size, temperature, and latitude across a 12\textdegree{} latitudinal gradient within the Scotia-Weddell sector. Intraspecific Bergmann's rule was found to apply to 8 of the 11 biomass-dominant species in the family Myctophidae. The rule was also apparent at an interspecific level. Our study suggests that greater attainable body size in this community is a necessary attribute to reach colder regions further south. The adherence of these taxa to Bergmann's rule enables such species to act as sentinels for identifying the drivers and consequences of ocean warming for the Southern Ocean ecosystem.}

  abstract = {For at least 200 years, since the time of Malthus, population growth has been recognized as providing a critical link between the performance of individual organisms and the ecology and evolution of species. We present a theory that shows how the intrinsic rate of exponential population growth, rmaxrmaxr\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{max\}\textbackslash,\}, and the carrying capacity, K, depend on individual metabolic rate and resource supply rate. To do this, we construct equations for the metabolic rates of entire populations by summing over individuals, and then we combine these population-level equations with Malthusian growth. Thus, the theory makes explicit the relationship between rates of resource supply in the environment and rates of production of new biomass and individuals. These individual-level and population-level processes are inextricably linked because metabolism sets both the demand for environmental resources and the resource allocation to survival, growth, and reproduction. We use the theory to make explicit how and why rmaxrmaxr\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{max\}\textbackslash,\} exhibits its characteristic dependence on body size and temperature. Data for aerobic eukaryotes, including algae, protists, insects, zooplankton, fishes, and mammals, support these predicted scalings for rmaxrmaxr\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{max\}\textbackslash,\}. The metabolic flux of energy and materials also dictates that the carrying capacity or equilibrium density of populations should decrease with increasing body size and increasing temperature. Finally, we argue that body mass and body temperature, through their effects on metabolic rate, can explain most of the variation in fecundity and mortality rates. Data for marine fishes in the field support these predictions for instantaneous rates of mortality. This theory links the rates of metabolism and resource use of individuals to life-history attributes and population dynamics for a broad assortment of organisms, from unicellular organisms to mammals.}

  abstract = {Many ectotherms have shown a reduction in maximum body size in the past decades in parallel with climate warming. Indeed, some models forecast a maximum body size decline of 14\%\textendash 24\% by 2050 for numerous fish species. The gill-oxygen limitation (GOL) hypothesis is perhaps the most prominent concept regarding the physiological mechanisms underlying the observed trends, implicating oxygen uptake limitations in driving the decline in fish body size with warming. Current scientific debates, however, demonstrate a clear need for a synthesis of existing empirical evidence to test the fundamental assumptions of the GOL hypothesis. Here, we perform a systematic literature review of the intraspecific allometry of gill surface area (GSA) and metabolic rate. Additionally, we introduce a new parameter, the ratio S, which provides a measure of GSA in relation to the metabolic requirements for maintenance (SSMR) and maximum activity (SAMR). Support for the GOL hypothesis would be evidenced by a universal decline in S with increasing body mass within each species, such that gills become less equipped to supply metabolic requirements as fish grow. In contrast to the predictions of the GOL hypothesis, we show that the scaling exponents for SSMR and SAMR are consistently close to zero, with only a few exceptions where S either increased or decreased. These findings suggest that the GSA of each species is sufficient to meet its oxygen requirements throughout life, and that growth is not universally restricted by oxygen uptake limitations across the gills. We identify the need to investigate hypotheses other than the GOL hypothesis to help explain the observed declines in maximum fish body sizes concurrent with climate warming, in order to facilitate accurate predictions of fish community structure and manage fisheries in the face of climate change.},

  abstract = {Linear mixed-effects models are powerful tools for analyzing complex datasets with repeated or clustered observations, a common data structure in ecology and evolution. Mixed-effects models involve complex fitting procedures and make several assumptions, in particular about the distribution of residual and random effects. Violations to these assumptions are common in real datasets, yet it is not always clear how much these violations matter to accurate and unbiased estimation. Here we address the consequences of violations in distributional assumptions and the impact of missing random effect components on model estimates. In particular, we evaluate the effects of skewed, bimodal and heteroscedastic random effect and residual variances, of missing random effect terms and of correlated fixed effect predictors. We focus on bias and prediction error on estimates of fixed and random effects. Model estimates were usually robust to violations of assumptions, with the exception of slight upward biases in estimates of random effect variance if the generating distribution was bimodal but was modelled by Gaussian error distributions. Further, estimates for (random effect) components that violated distributional assumptions became less precise but remained unbiased. However, this particular problem did not affect other parameters of the model. The same pattern was found for strongly correlated fixed effects, which led to imprecise, but unbiased estimates, with uncertainty estimates reflecting imprecision. Unmodeled sources of random-effect variance had predictable effects on variance component estimates. The pattern is best viewed as a cascade of hierarchical grouping factors. Variances trickle down the hierarchy such that missing higher-level random effect variances pool at lower levels and missing lower-level and crossed random effect variances manifest as residual variance. Overall, our results show remarkable robustness of mixed-effects models that should allow researchers to use mixed-effects models even if the distributional assumptions are objectively violated. However, this does not free researchers from careful evaluation of the model. Estimates that are based on data that show clear violations of key assumptions should be treated with caution because individual datasets might give highly imprecise estimates, even if they will be unbiased on average across datasets.},

``However, coefficients of categorical predictors are estimated as slopes in linear regression models and, with treatment contrasts, are thus implicitly coded as 0 and 1 (Table 1).'' (Schielzeth, 2010, p. 105)

``Manual coding is done by constructing k ) 1 indicator or dummy variables (where k is the number of levels of the categorical predictor) that take a value of 1 if the record belongs to a specific category and 0 otherwise'' (Schielzeth, 2010, p. 105)
\par
``One category is set to 0 for all indicators and hence serves as a reference category that is estimated as the intercept (hence k )'' (Schielzeth, 2010, p. 105)
\par
``Centring indicators will lead to other main effects and the intercept being estimated at this predictor being zero, i.e. at an imaginary mean category (Table 1, Gelman \& Hill 2007). Although this seems inappropriate, since there are no observations at this value of the indicator, this makes sense if we are interested in the average effect across different levels of the categorical predictor (Gelman \& Hill 2007).''

``There are well-justified warnings against the interpretation of main effects when the input variables are involved in interactions'' (Schielzeth, 2010, p. 105)

\par
``Centring effectively removes the correlation between slopes and intercepts and makes treatment main effects meaningful independent of the slopes'' (Schielzeth, 2010, p. 105)
\par
``Polynomials are interactions between continuous input variables and themselves'' (Schielzeth, 2010, p. 106)
\par
``Unlike dedicated functions that will return orthogonal polynomials, squaring raw input variables will usually not result in uncorrelated predictors'' (Schielzeth, 2010, p. 106)
\par
``With a focus on parameter estimation and inference, the main motivation for including polynomials should be to test for curvature in addition to linear effects and it is desirable to estimate linear and curvature effects in the same model'' (Schielzeth, 2010, p. 106)
\par
``Independence of the two terms can be easily achieved by centring input variables before squaring them (Gelman 2008; e.g. r =0\AE 04 after centring for the same input variable as above). After centring, the estimate for the linear term will express the linear effect (e.g. higher predictor values yield higher response values), while the estimate for the quadratic term estimates if extremes of the distribution elicit higher (positive slopes) or lower (negative slopes) response values on top of possible linear relationships'' (Schielzeth, 2010, p. 106)
\par
``Including two continuous input variables and their interactions without centring the input variables will result in an interaction predictors that is collinear with the main effects (e.g. the correlation between raw input variables and the interaction term were r =0\AE 70 and r =0\AE 54 for two input variables drawn at random from normal distributions with means = 12 and SD = 4).'' (Schielzeth, 2010, p. 107)
\par
``In linear models with multiple predictors, it is often of interest to judge the importance of individual predictors (Healy 1990; Chao et al. 2008). There has been some controversy about how to measure the importance of parameters in linear models, because with correlated predictors there is no unique way to partition the variance in the response'' (Schielzeth, 2010, p. 107)

\par
``I will assume the model structure to be known, i.e. the fitted model will contain all influential effects and all predictors included in the model are meaningful and of interested to the researcher.'' (Schielzeth, 2010, p. 107)

``Estimating group means appropriately'' (Schielzeth, 2010, p. 109)

``In a linear model with categorical predictors an initial purpose is usually to test for differences between groups. For display, however, we often want to show the individual group means and their appropriate standard errors'' (Schielzeth, 2010, p. 109)
\par
``Since in a standard linear model with treatment contrasts, one factor level is used as a reference (and estimated as the intercept), the other factor levels are expressed as contrasts (or differences) to the reference category (Table 1). It is easy to calculate the appropriate group means by adding the contrasts to the intercept for all non-reference groups. However, the standard errors for the contrasts given by the model output are not the appropriate standard errors for the group means.'' (Schielzeth, 2010, p. 110)

  abstract = {The fishery for Northern Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) off Newfoundland and Labrador, Eastern Canada, presents the most spectacular case of an exploited stock crashed in a few decades by an industrial bottom trawl fishery under a seemingly sophisticated management regime after half a millennium of sustainable fishing. The fishery, which had generated annual catches of 100000 to 200000 tonnes from the beginning of the 16th century to the 1950s, ~peaked in 1968 at 810000 tonnes, followed by a devastating collapse and closure 24 years later. Since then, stock recovery may have been hindered by premature openings, with vessels targeting the remains of the cod population. Previous research paid little attention towards using multicentury time series to inform sustainable catches and recovery plans. Here, we show that a simple stock assessment model can be used to model the cod population trajectory for the entire period from 1508 to 2019 for which catch estimates are available. The model suggests that if fishing effort and mortality had been stabilized in the 1980s, ~precautionary annual yields of about 200000 tonnes could have been sustained. Our analysis demonstrates the value of incorporating prior knowledge to counteract shifting baseline effects on reference points and contemporary perceptions of historical stock status.},

While estimating the temperature dependence of performance traits such as growth and development rate is feasible under controlled laboratory settings, predictions in nature are difficult. One major challenge lies in translating performance under constant conditions to fluctuating environments. Using the butterfly Pieris napi as model system, we show that development rate, an important fitness trait, can be accurately predicted in the field using models parameterized under constant laboratory temperatures. Additionally, using a factorial design, we show that accurate predictions can be made across microhabitats but critically hinge on adequate consideration of non-linearity in reaction norms, spatial heterogeneity in microclimate and temporal variation in temperature. Our empirical results are also supported by a comparison of published and simulated data. Conclusively, our combined results suggest that, discounting direct effects of temperature, insect development rates are generally unaffected by thermal fluctuations.},

This approach offers a new perspective on the interplay of complex interactions within food webs and is easily extendable to include phylogenetic and other body-mass independent traits.

The main objective of this study was to determine the optimal growth temperature of juvenile Dover sole (Solea solea) and in addition to test the hypothesis that the final preferendum equals the optimal growth temperature. Temperature preference was measured in a circular preference chamber for Dover sole acclimated to 18, 22 and 28 degrees C. Optimal growth temperature was measured by rearing Dover sole at 19, 22, 25 and 28 degrees C. The optimal growth temperature resulting from this growth experiment was 22.7 degrees C for Dover sole with a size between 30 to 50 g. The temperature preferred by juvenile Dover sole increases with acclimation temperature and exceeds the optimal temperature for growth. A final preferendum could not be detected. Although a confounding effect of behavioural fever on temperature preference could not be entirely excluded, thermal preference and thermal optima for physiological processes seem to be unrelated in Dover sole.},

  abstract = {* Matrix models or integral projection models (IPMs) are commonly used to study the dynamics of structured populations, where discrete or continuous traits influence survival, growth or reproduction. * When a population's size is small, as is often the case for threatened species or potentially invasive species arriving in novel habitats, extinction risk may be substantial due to demographic stochasticity. Branching processes, which are individual-based counterparts to matrix models and IPMs, allow one to quantify these risks of extinction. * For discretely structured populations, the theory of multitype branching processes provides analytic methods to compute how extinction risk changes over time and how it depends on the size and composition of the population. Building on prior work on continuous-state branching processes, we extend these analytic methods to individual-based models accounting for any mixture of discrete and continuous population structure. * The individual-based IPMs are defined by probabilistic update rules at the level of the individual which determine how each individual with a given trait value dies, changes trait values (e.g. grows in size) or produces individuals with the same or other trait values. We show that probabilities of extinction can be analytically determined by probability-generating functionals associated with the individual-based IPMs. In particular, we present analytical expressions for how extinction probabilities change over time and depend on the initial abundance and trait distribution of the population. * We illustrate how to numerically implement these methods using data from the short-lived desert shrub species Cryptantha flava and provide a more general discussion of how to implement these methods to other data sets including those involving fluctuating environmental conditions. * As most IPM studies have the necessary data to parameterize individual-based IPMs, these methods provide a computationally efficient means to explore how continuously structured populations differing in their evolutionary history and environmental context may differ in their vulnerability to extinction or ability to colonize new habitats.}

  abstract = {Size-selective mortality inevitably leads to a decrease in population density and exerts a direct negative effect on targeted size classes. But density and population size structure are also shaped by food-dependent processes, such as individual growth, maturation, and reproduction. Mortality relaxes competition and thereby alters the dynamic interplay among these processes. As shown by the recently developed size-structured theory, which can account for food-dependent individual performance, this altered interplay can lead to overcompensatory responses in size class-specific biomass, with increasing mortality. We experimentally tested this theory by subjecting laboratory fish populations to a range of size-selective mortality rates. Overall, the results were in agreement with theoretical predictions. Biomass of the juvenile size class increased above control levels at intermediate adult mortality rates and thereafter declined at high mortality rates. Juvenile biomass also increased when juveniles themselves were subjected to intermediate mortality rates. Biomass in other size classes decreased with mortality. Such biomass overcompensation can have wide-ranging implications for communities and food webs, including a high sensitivity of top predators to irreversible catastrophic collapses, the establishment of alternative stable community states, and the promotion of coexistence and biodiversity.},

  abstract = {Because of its profound effects on the rates of biological processes such as aerobic metabolism, environmental temperature plays an important role in shaping the distribution and abundance of species. As temperature increases, the rate of metabolism increases and then rapidly declines at higher temperatures - a response that can be described using a thermal performance curve (TPC). Although the shape of the TPC for aerobic metabolism is often attributed to the competing effects of thermodynamics, which can be described using the Arrhenius equation, and the effects of temperature on protein stability, this account represents an over-simplification of the factors acting even at the level of single proteins. In addition, it cannot adequately account for the effects of temperature on complex multistep processes, such as aerobic metabolism, that rely on mechanisms acting across multiple levels of biological organization. The purpose of this review is to explore our current understanding of the factors that shape the TPC for aerobic metabolism in response to acute changes in temperature, and to highlight areas where this understanding is weak or insufficient. Developing a more strongly grounded mechanistic model to account for the shape of the TPC for aerobic metabolism is crucial because these TPCs are the foundation of several recent attempts to predict the responses of species to climate change, including the metabolic theory of ecology and the hypothesis of oxygen and capacity-limited thermal tolerance.},

Here, we derived a quantifiable linkage between maximum and basal metabolic rate and their oxygen, temperature and size dependencies. We show that, regardless of size or temperature, the physiological capacity for oxygen supply precisely matches the maximum evolved demand at the highest persistently available oxygen pressure and this is the critical PO2 for the maximum metabolic rate, Pcrit-max. For most terrestrial and shallow-living marine species, Pcrit-max is the current atmospheric pressure, 21 kPa. Any reduction in oxygen partial pressure from current values will result in a calculable decrement in maximum metabolic performance. However, oxygen supply capacity has evolved to match demand across temperatures and body sizes and so does not constrain thermal tolerance or cause the well-known reduction in mass-specific metabolic rate with increasing body mass. The critical oxygen pressure for resting metabolic rate, typically viewed as an indicator of hypoxia tolerance, is, instead, simply a rate-specific reflection of the oxygen supply capacity. A compensatory reduction in maintenance metabolic costs in warm-adapted species constrains factorial aerobic scope and the critical PO2 to a similar range, between {$\sim$}2 and 6, across each species' natural temperature range. The simple new relationship described here redefines many important physiological concepts and alters their ecological interpretation.},

Nontrophic (e.g. predator interference) and trophic components together determine species interaction strengths, but the effects of environmental factors on these two components remain largely unknown. This impedes our ability to fully understand the links between environmental drivers and species interactions. Here, we used a dynamical modelling framework based on measured predator functional responses to investigate the effects of predator diversity, prey density, and temperature on trophic and nontrophic interaction strengths within a freshwater food web. We found that (i) species interaction strengths cannot be predicted from trophic interactions alone, (ii) nontrophic interaction strengths vary strongly among predator assemblages, (iii) temperature has opposite effects on trophic and nontrophic interaction strengths, and (iv) trophic interaction strengths decrease with prey density, whereas the dependence of nontrophic interaction strengths on prey density is concave up. Interestingly, the qualitative impacts of temperature and prey density on the strengths of trophic and nontrophic interactions were independent of predator identity, suggesting a general pattern. Our results indicate that taking multiple environmental factors and the nonlinearity of density-dependent species interactions into account is an important step towards a better understanding of the effects of environmental variations on complex ecological communities. The functional response approach used in this study opens new avenues for (i) the quantification of the relative importance of the trophic and nontrophic components in species interactions and (ii) a better understanding how environmental factors affect these interactions and the dynamics of ecological communities.},

We found that TS responses often increase community persistence, mainly by modifying consumer-resource size ratios and thereby altering interaction strengths and energetic efficiencies. However, the sign and magnitude of these effects vary with warming and enrichment levels, TS responses of constituent species, and community size structure. We predict that the consequences of TS responses are stronger in aquatic than in terrestrial ecosystems, especially when species show different TS responses. We conclude that considering the links between phenotypic plasticity, environmental drivers and species interactions is crucial to better predict global change impacts on ecosystem diversity and stability.},

  abstract = {A central and classic question in ecology is what causes populations to fluctuate in abundance. Understanding the interaction between natural drivers of fluctuating populations and human exploitation is an issue of paramount importance for conservation and natural resource management. Three main hypotheses have been proposed to explain fluctuations: (i) species interactions, such as predator-prey interactions, cause fluctuations, (ii) strongly nonlinear single-species dynamics cause fluctuations, and (iii) environmental variation cause fluctuations. We combine a general fisheries model with data from a global sample of fish species to assess how two of these hypothesis, nonlinear single-species dynamics and environmental variation, interact with human exploitation to affect the variability of fish populations. In contrast with recent analyses that suggest fishing drives increased fluctuations by changing intrinsic nonlinear dynamics, we show that single-species nonlinear dynamics alone, both in the presence and absence of fisheries, are unlikely to drive deterministic fluctuations in fish; nearly all fish populations fall into regions of stable dynamics. However, adding environmental variation dramatically alters the consequences of exploitation on the temporal variability of populations. In a variable environment, (i) the addition of mortality from fishing leads to increased temporal variability for all species examined, (ii) variability in recruitment rates of juveniles contributes substantially more to fluctuations than variation in adult mortality, and (iii) the correlation structure of juvenile and adult vital rates plays an important and underappreciated role in determining population fluctuations. Our results are robust to alternative model formulations and to a range of environmental autocorrelation.},

Studies of anadromous species often focus on freshwater despite the ocean's disproportionate influence on survival and growth. To understand a prominent anadromous species' response to ocean climate, we use a new spatio-temporal model jointly estimating the ocean distribution of all major fall-run Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, Salmonidae) stocks from California to British Columbia over 40 years. We model hundreds of millions of tagged individuals, finding that different stocks have fundamentally different ocean distributions, distinct associations with sea surface temperature (SST), and contrasting distributional responses to historical ocean SST variation. We show species-level estimates of ocean distribution that ignore among-stock variation will lead to errant predictions of spatial distribution. Using future (2030\textendash 2090) SST projections to model focal stocks of fisheries importance we predict substantial ocean redistribution in response to SST change. Predicted aggregate distributional changes do not follow a simple, poleward shift. Instead, we predict net movement into some ocean regions (British Columbia, central California) but net movement out of others (northern California, Washington). Distribution shifts have implications for both major fisheries and marine mammal predators of Chinook salmon. We focus on the consequences of spatial changes in ocean distribution, but our approach provides a general structure to link marine and freshwater components of anadromous species under climate change.},

  abstract = {Cod populations in Newfoundland and Labrador waters have shown differing growth, condition and recruitment since near-universal declines in these properties during the cold period of the late 1980s and early 1990s. To assess the influence of variable prey communities on these parameters, we compared cod energetics and diet in populations off Labrador and the northeast and south coasts of Newfoundland. Many properties were highest in the southern group(s) and lowest in the northern group(s), including growth, somatic condition, liver index and age-at-maturity. Most differences could be explained by variations in diet, as measured by stomach contents and stable carbon isotopes (d13C). The diet of Labrador cod consisted almost entirely of northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis), and these cod displayed the most benthic d13C signatures. Northeast cod had a more varied diet that included capelin and other fish, but still had mostly benthic d13C signatures, suggesting the importance of benthic prey like shrimp in this population. South coast cod exhibited the most varied diet, including capelin (Mallotus villosus), zooplankton, crabs and other fish, and had the most pelagic d13C signatures. Among and within populations, the benefits of a more pelagic diet in medium-sized (30\textendash 69 cm) cod included higher somatic condition, higher liver index (lipid stores) and greater spawning potential (decreased incidence of atresia). It is hypothesized that major rebuilding of Newfoundland and Labrador cod stocks will require a return to a system that supports mostly pelagic feeding (i.e. capelin) in cod.},

  abstract = {Large variations in the activity and scaling patterns of enzymes involved in anaerobic metabolism exist and appear to be related to species differences in the locomotory habits of fish. Here, we show how the scaling of muscle lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity is highly variable in fish, not only among species, but also among populations of yellow perch (Perca flavescens) and lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) exhibiting large differences in the scaling of fish activity costs. These differences in LDH scaling properties were significantly related to differences in diet ontogeny. Scaling coefficients and adjusted R2 values of LDH versus body size relationships were both threefold higher in fish that do not make important diet shifts among planktivory, benthivory, and piscivory than in those that do. We argue that fish activity and related glycolytic potential are reset to lower values whenever fish are able to switch diet to larger prey while growing; we implicate the burst component of foraging (mostly attacks) as being responsible for changes in activity costs. Our results suggest that anaerobic power requirements in fish are highly plastic and adapted to local and recent food web conditions. We discuss these findings in relation to optimal foraging theory and the energetic basis of prey-size selection.},

Recently, novel simulation techniques, advances in computing power, and numerical methods for implementing statistical models have significantly advanced our ability to integrate empirical and theoretical ecology. However, a divide still remains between mathematical and empirical studies, their readership, and integration into the broader literature. Because insights from mathematical ecology are far more general than the techniques employed, limitations in communicating mathematical advances to a broad spectrum of ecologists have arguably hindered ecology's progress, particularly in confronting theoretical predictions with empirical experiments and data. Here, we present a guide for both authors and readers of mathematical ecology, with the aim of increasing the accessibility of mathematical ecology for a broad group of ecologists. We provide a list of best practices when both writing and reading mathematical ecology, incorporating examples from this Special Feature of Ecosphere.

  abstract = {We focus on the zero-catch problem of CPUE (catch per unit effort) standardization. Because the traditional CPUE model with a log-normal error structure cannot be applied in this case, three methods have often been utilized as follows:(1)Ad hoc method adds a small constant value to all response variables.(2)Catch model with a Poisson or negative-binomial (NB) error structure.(3)Delta-type two-step method such as the delta-normal model (after estimating the ratio of zero-catch using a logit or probit model, a model such as CPUE log-normal or Catch-Poisson is applied to CPUE without zero-data). However, there are some statistical problems with each of these methods. In this paper, we carried out the CPUE standardization mainly using the Tweedie distribution model based on the actual by-catch data (silky shark, Carcharhimus falciformis, in the North Pacific Ocean caught by Japanese training vessels) including many observations with zero-catch ({$>$}2/3rd) and tuna fishery data as a target (yellowfin tuna, Thunnus albacares, in the Indian Ocean caught by Japanese commercial vessels) where the ratio of zero-catch is not so high ({$<$}1/3rd). The Tweedie model is an extension of compound Poisson model derived from the stochastic process where the weight of the counted objects (i.e., number of fish) has a gamma distribution and has an advantage of handling the zero-catch data in a unified way. We also compared four candidate models, the Catch-NB model, ad hoc method, Delta-lognormal model (delta-type two-step method) and Tweedie distribution, through CPUE analyses of actual fishery data in terms of the statistical performance. Square error and Pearson's correlation coefficient were calculated based on the observed CPUE and the corresponding predicted CPUE using the n-fold cross-validation. As a result, the differences in the trend of CPUE between years and model performance between the ad hoc method and Tweedie model were found to be not so large in the example of yellowfin tuna (target species). However, the statistical performance of Tweedie distribution is rather better than Delta-lognormal model, the Catch-NB distribution and ad hoc method in the example of silky shark (by-catch species). Standardized CPUE year trend of ad hoc method was found to be quite different from that of the Tweedie distribution and other two models. Model performance of the Tweedie distribution is good judging from the 5-fold cross-validation using the fishery data if including many zero-catch data such as by-catch species.},

We tested the impact of elevated temperature on the top-down and bottom-up forces structuring experimental freshwater pond food webs in western Canada over 16 months. Experimental warming was crossed with treatments manipulating the presence of planktivorous fish and eutrophication through enhanced nutrient supply. We found that higher temperatures produced top-heavy food webs with lower biomass of benthic and pelagic producers, equivalent biomass of zooplankton, zoobenthos and pelagic bacteria, and more pelagic viruses. Eutrophication increased the biomass of all organisms studied, while fish had cascading positive effects on periphyton, phytoplankton and bacteria, and reduced biomass of invertebrates. Surprisingly, virus biomass was reduced in the presence of fish, suggesting the possibility for complex mechanisms of top-down control of the lytic cycle. Warming reduced the effects of eutrophication on periphyton, and magnified the already strong effects of fish on phytoplankton and bacteria. Warming, fish and nutrients all increased whole-system rates of net production despite their distinct impacts on the distribution of biomass between producers and consumers, plankton and benthos, and microbes and macrobes. Our results indicate that warming exerts a host of indirect effects on aquatic food webs mediated through shifts in the magnitudes of top-down and bottom-up forcing.},

The fish (start weight 17 g) were reared for 5 months at constant temperatures of 12, 14 and 16\textdegree C under a continuous light regime (LD24:0). Growth performance was significantly influenced by both temperature and source population. The offspring from the farmed fish displayed significantly higher mean weights at all temperatures compared with the offspring from the wild fish. The results indicate that the optimal temperature for growth (Topt) decreases with increasing fish size in the offspring of both cultivated and wild fish. Significant differences in length\textendash weight relationship were found, with the offspring of wild fish displaying higher condition factor throughout the experiment. The results demonstrate that the offspring from multiple generation farmed population of arctic charr are better adapted to high temperatures compared with the offspring (F1 generation) from a wild population of arctic charr, and the former are also able to maintain growth at higher temperatures. There was a significant difference in maturation between the two populations, as the offspring from cultured fish displayed significantly lower level of maturation: 0\%, 4\% and 2\% mature compared with 24\%, 40\% and 42\% in the offspring from wild fish at temperatures of 12, 14 and 16\textdegree C respectively. The offspring from farmed strains of arctic charr thus appear to be the most suitable population for aquaculture.},

We assessed the full impacts of warming on the commercially important European continental shelf fish assemblage using a data-driven Eulerian (grid-based) approach that accommodates spatial heterogeneity in ecological and environmental conditions.

We demonstrate responses to warming in 72\% of common species, with three times more species increasing in abundance than declining, and find these trends reflected in international commercial landings. Profound reorganization of the relative abundance of species in local communities occurred despite decadal stability in the presence-absence of species. Our analysis highlights the importance of focusing on changes in species abundance in established local communities to assess the full consequences of climate change for commercial fisheries and food security.},

  abstract = {Natural mortality (M) is both a highly consequential and difficult process to estimate in stock assessments. Because of its correlation with other influential parameters, and the inadequacy of data to understand how it varies with time and ontogeny, estimates of M from integrated assessment models are often considered implausible. This has lead to the assumption that estimates of M are highly uncertain within integrated assessments and it is commonly fixed at values consistent with understanding about the stock's life history or derived from external analyses. Researchers recently used simulation analysis to challenge this assumption and provided evidence that M might be estimable under certain conditions. Our research builds upon those results by using the recently proposed age-structured production model diagnostic to help identify the conditions under which M might be estimable. This diagnostic aims to determine if changes in the scale and trend of stock abundance can be explained by catch alone, which is a key indicator of the presence of a production function. We apply the production model diagnostic to the same suit of assessments used in the aforementioned simulations to determine if a relationship between estimability of M and the presence of a production function can be identified. Statistical and subjective approaches to interpreting the production model diagnostic were developed with the aim of providing guidance on when M might be estimable. Statistical approaches to identifying the presence/absence of a production function did not outperform the subjective measure, but meaningful guidance about estimating M is still apparent. Our results provide more weight to the notion of M being estimable under certain conditions, and we provide guidance on identifying those conditions.},

The objective of the present study was to identify the factors that influence interannual variations in the somatic growth rate of herring (Clupea harengus) in the Baltic Sea. This work covers otolith samples collected from commercial catches and during scientific surveys from 1951 to 2017 in the Polish zone of the southern part of the Baltic. Otolith increment widths, which represent changes in fish growth, were analyzed with linear mixed models to investigate different intrinsic and extrinsic sources of fish growth variation. The stock biomass of pelagic species (herring and sprat Sprattus sprattus), sea surface temperature, Baltic Sea Index and land precipitation over the catchment area were considered potential predictors of herring growth. Methods to identify the optimal time window for environmental factors were incorporated in the modeling. Moreover, a wavelet coherence analysis, tests for identification of regime shifts in fish growth and a spatial correlation analysis were applied to the data. The developed multidecadal otolith-based biochronology showed that the growth of Baltic herring is under the strong influence of interspecific competition between herring and sprat, but the biochronology also indicated a high correlation with precipitation patterns over the runoff area and hydrological conditions within the Baltic Sea. A detailed investigation revealed that the relationships between herring growth and abiotic conditions or other ecosystem components can vary over time. The recognized complex ecological effects on herring growth necessitate the application of holistic ecosystem-based approaches for sustainable management and exploitation of small pelagic fish resources.},

  abstract = {Lake Thingvallavatn supports four trophic morphs of Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus (L.); two of the morphs are benthic (small and large benthivorous charr) one exploits pelagic waters (planktivorous charr) and the fourth is found in both habitats (piscivorous charr). The morphological variation among these morphs was analysed by use of principal component analysis and canonical discriminant analysis. The benihic morphs have a short lower jaw and long pectoral fins. The benthic fish also have fewer gillrakers than the other morphs. Small and large benthivorous charrs attain sexual maturity from 2 and 6 years of age, and at fork lengths from 7 and 22 cm, respectively. Small benthivorous charr retain their juvenile parr marks as adults, have beige ventral colours, and are frequently melanized under the lower jaw. Planktivorous and piscivorous charr attain sexual maturity from 4 and 6 years of age, from fork lengths of 15 and 23 cm, respectively. This phenotypic polymorphism is associated with habitat utilization and diet of the fish, and has probably arisen within the lake system through diversification and niche specialization. The pelagic morphs apparently stem from a single population, and are possibly diversified through conditional niche shifts which affect ontogeny. Juveniles reaching a body length of 23 cm may change from zooplankton to fish feeding. Asymptotic length increases thereby from 20.5 cm in planktivorous charr to 30.2 cm in piscivorous charr. The benthic morphs appear to represent separate populations, although both feed chiefly on the gastropod Lymnaea peregra. Their co-existence seems to be facilitated by size dependent constraints on habitat use. The small morph (asymptotic length 13.3 cm) exploit the interstitial crevices in the lava block substratum, whereas the large morph (asymptotic length 55.4 cm) live epibenthically.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present the R package deSolve to solve initial value problems (IVP) written as ordinary differential equations (ODE), differential algebraic equations (DAE) of index 0 or 1 and partial differential equations (PDE), the latter solved using the method of lines approach. The differential equations can be represented in R code or as compiled code. In the latter case, R is used as a tool to trigger the integration and post-process the results, which facilitates model development and application, whilst the compiled code significantly increases simulation speed. The methods implemented are efficient, robust, and well documented public-domain Fortran routines. They include four integrators from the ODEPACK package (LSODE, LSODES, LSODA, LSODAR), DVODE and DASPK2.0. In addition, a suite of Runge-Kutta integrators and special-purpose solvers to efficiently integrate 1-, 2- and 3-dimensional partial differential equations are available. The routines solve both stiff and non-stiff systems, and include many options, e. g., to deal in an efficient way with the sparsity of the Jacobian matrix, or finding the root of equations. In this article, our objectives are threefold: (1) to demonstrate the potential of using R for dynamic modeling, (2) to highlight typical uses of the different methods implemented and (3) to compare the performance of models specified in R code and in compiled code for a number of test cases. These comparisons demonstrate that, if the use of loops is avoided, R code can efficiently integrate problems comprising several thousands of state variables. Nevertheless, the same problem may be solved from 2 to more than 50 times faster by using compiled code compared to an implementation using only R code. Still, amongst the bene fits of R are a more flexible and interactive implementation, better readability of the code, and access to R's high-level procedures. deSolve is the successor of packageo desolve which will be deprecated in the future; it is free software and distributed under the GNU General Public License, as part of the R software project.},

Studies of congeneric invertebrates from thermally stressful rocky intertidal habitats have shown that warm-adapted congeners are most susceptible to local extinctions because their acute upper thermal limits (LT(50) values) lie near current thermal maxima and their abilities to increase thermal tolerance through acclimation are limited. Collapse of cardiac function may underlie acute and longer-term thermal limits. Local extinctions from heat death may be offset by in-migration of genetically warm-adapted conspecifics from mid-latitude 'hot spots', where midday low tides in summer select for heat tolerance. A single amino acid replacement is sufficient to adapt a protein to a new thermal range. More challenging to adaptive evolution are lesions in genomes of stenotherms like Antarctic marine ectotherms, which have lost protein-coding genes and gene regulatory mechanisms needed for coping with rising temperature. These extreme stenotherms, along with warm-adapted eurytherms living near their thermal limits, may be the major 'losers' from climate change.},

  abstract = {Fisheries have reduced the abundances of large piscivores\textemdash such as gadids (cod, pollock, etc.) and tunas\textemdash in ecosystems around the world. Fisheries also target smaller species\textemdash such as herring, capelin, and sprat\textemdash that are important parts of the piscivores' diets. It has been suggested that harvesting of these so-called forage fish will harm piscivores. Multispecies models used for fisheries assessments typically ignore important facets of fish community dynamics, such as individual-level bioenergetics and/or size structure. We test the effects of fishing for both forage fish and piscivores using a dynamic, multitrophic, size-structured, bioenergetics model of the Baltic Sea. In addition, we analyze historical patterns in piscivore-biomass declines and fishing mortalities of piscivores and forage fish using global fish-stock assessment data. Our community-dynamics model shows that piscivores benefit from harvesting of their forage fish when piscivore fishing mortality is high. With substantial harvesting of forage fish, the piscivores can withstand higher fishing mortality. On the other hand, when piscivore fishing mortality is low, piscivore biomass decreases with more fishing of the forage fish. In accordance with these predictions, our statistical analysis of global fisheries data shows a positive interaction between the fishing mortalities of forage-fish stocks and piscivore stocks on the strength of piscivore-biomass declines. While overfishing of forage fish must be prevented, our study shows that reducing fishing pressures on forage fish may have unwanted negative side effects on piscivores. In some cases, decreasing forage-fish exploitation could cause declines, or even collapses, of piscivore stocks.},

This study presents evidence that age-0 pollock changes in vertical distribution were related to changes in ocean annual temperature. Age-0 pollock went from occurring deeper in the water column during cold periods to being surface-oriented during warm periods, potentially exacerbating spatial mismatches between pollock and prey. We relate patterns in a vertical position to physical water column properties, feeding, and bioenergetic condition of collected pollock and discuss implications for recruitment success during different thermal oceanographic stanzas.},

  abstract = {When making predictions about ecosystems, we often have available a number of different ecosystem models that attempt to represent their dynamics in a detailed mechanistic way. Each of these can be used as a simulator of large-s\- cale experiments and make projections about the fate of ecosystems under different scenarios to support the development of appropriate management strategies. However, structural differences, systematic discrepancies and uncertainties lead to different models giving different predictions. This is further complicated by the fact that the models may not be run with the same functional groups, spatial structure or time scale. Rather than simply trying to select a ``best'' model, or taking some weighted average, it is important to exploit the strengths of each of the models, while learning from the differences between them. To achieve this, we construct a flexible statistical model of the relationships between a collection of mechanistic models and their biases, allowing for structural and parameter uncertainty and for different ways of representing reality. Using this statistical meta-m\- odel, we can combine prior beliefs, model estimates and direct observations using Bayesian methods and make coherent predictions of future outcomes under different scenarios with robust measures of uncertainty. In this study, we take a diverse ensemble of existing North Sea ecosystem models and demonstrate the utility of our framework by applying it to answer the question what would have happened to demersal fish if fishing was to stop.},

Age-specific density maps suggested a circular ontogenic migration during the summer feeding season, with the youngest and oldest groups most broadly distributed. Range correlation analysis among age groups and year classes provided clear evidence of a population cohort effect in the spatial distribution of the population. Variance decomposition analysis indicated that the variance in the spatial distribution of age groups during summer was influenced by the initial distribution of that cohort as recruits. Model-based analyses showed that extrinsic temperature variables affected the youngest and oldest age classes the most, but provided no indication of age-related effects for intrinsic population factors. This study showed that both cohort and age-specific factors are important drivers of spatial distribution.},

Insufficient systematic broadscale monitoring limits our understanding of the true extent of these impacts and our capacity to track these at scales relevant to national policies and international agreements. Using an extensive time series of co-located reef fish community structure and habitat data spanning 12 years and the entire Australian continent, we found that reef fish community responses to changing temperatures and habitats are dynamic and widespread but regionally patchy. Shifts in composition and abundance of the fish community often occurred within 2 years of environmental or habitat change, although the relative importance of these two mechanisms of climate impact tended to differ between tropical and temperate zones. The clearest of these changes on temperate and subtropical reefs were temperature related, with responses measured by the reef fish thermal index indicating reshuffling according to the thermal affinities of species present. On low latitude coral reefs, the community generalization index indicated shifting dominance of habitat generalist fishes through time, concurrent with changing coral cover. Our results emphasize the importance of maintaining local ecological detail when scaling up datasets to inform national policies and global biodiversity targets. Scaled-up ecological monitoring is needed to discriminate among increasingly diverse drivers of large-scale biodiversity change and better connect presently disjointed systems of biodiversity observation, indicator research, and governance.},

  abstract = {The California Current Marine Ecosystem is a highly productive system that exhibits strong natural variability and vulnerability to anthropogenic climate trends. Relating projections of ocean change to biological sensitivities requires detailed synthesis of experimental results. Here, we combine measured biological sensitivities with high-resolution climate projections of key variables (temperature, oxygen, and pCO2) to identify the direction, magnitude, and spatial distribution of organism-scale vulnerabilities to multiple axes of projected ocean change. Among 12 selected species of cultural and economic importance, we find that all are sensitive to projected changes in ocean conditions through responses that affect individual performance or population processes. Response indices were largest in the northern region and inner shelf. While performance traits generally increased with projected changes, fitness traits generally decreased, indicating that concurrent stresses can lead to fitness loss. For two species, combining sensitivities to temperature and oxygen changes through the Metabolic Index shows how aerobic habitat availability could be compressed under future conditions. Our results suggest substantial and specific ecological susceptibility in the next 80 years, including potential regional loss of canopy-forming kelp, changes in nearshore food webs caused by declining rates of survival among red urchins, Dungeness crab, and razor clams, and loss of aerobic habitat for anchovy and pink shrimp. We also highlight fillable gaps in knowledge, including specific physiological responses to stressors, variation in responses across life stages, and responses to multistressor combinations. These findings strengthen the case for filling information gaps with experiments focused on fitness-related responses and those that can be used to parameterize integrative physiological models, and suggest that the CCME is susceptible to substantial changes to ecosystem structure and function within this century.},

We found that thermal tolerance breadths generally increase with latitude, and do so at a greater rate in the Northern Hemisphere. In terrestrial ectotherms, upper thermal limits vary little while lower thermal limits decrease with latitude. By contrast, marine species display a coherent poleward decrease in both upper and lower thermal limits. Our findings provide comprehensive global support for hypotheses generated from studies at smaller taxonomic subsets and geographical scales.

Climate velocity explained some variation in range shifts, however, including species traits more than doubled the variation explained. Swimming ability, omnivory and latitudinal range size all had positive relationships with range extension rate, supporting hypotheses that increased dispersal capacity and ecological generalism promote extensions. We find independent support for the hypothesis that species with narrow latitudinal ranges are limited by factors other than climate. Our findings suggest that small-ranging species are in double jeopardy, with limited ability to escape warming and greater intrinsic vulnerability to stochastic disturbances.},

One complication in answering this question is that an organism's temperature tolerance can change throughout its life span, and organisms in early life stages may be more sensitive to cold and heat extremes than adults (the stage commonly measured) (1, 2). On page 65 of this issue, Dahlke et al. (3) report comparisons of the thermal tolerance limits of almost 700 freshwater and marine fish species at four life stages. Their findings confirm that embryos, and the reproductive adults who produce them, tolerate narrower temperature extremes than larvae and nonspawning adults, with thermal breadths (the difference between upper and lower thermal tolerance) that are narrower by an average of 20\textdegree C. As a result of this difference, projected climate vulnerabilities of fishes are greater than previously thought. Greater sensitivity in fish reproductive stages reveals vulnerability to climate change Greater sensitivity in fish reproductive stages reveals vulnerability to climate change},

Food consumption, fecal production, nitrogenous excretion, growth rate and metabolic rate of cobia were affected significantly by both water temperature and fish size. However, the relationships between food energy and feces, excretion, growth and metabolism energy exhibited linear curves and seemed independent of water temperature and fish size in the present study. For each fish size growth increased with temperature up to 33 \textdegree C and then declined at 35 \textdegree C. The optimal temperature for growth (Topt.G) of 10\textendash 200 g cobia was 33 \textdegree C. For each water temperature growth was negatively correlated to fish size and the model, SGR = a + blnW or SGR = aWb, provided a good fit to the data obtained for 10\textendash 200 g cobia. Food conversion efficiency (FCE) was highest at 31 \textdegree C and lowest at 35 \textdegree C for each size cobia. The optimal temperature for FCE (Topt.FCE) of 10\textendash 200 g cobia was 31 \textdegree C. An increasing trend of FCE with fish size was seen at each temperature and indicated that larger cobia had a superior capacity of food utilization. Energy budgets of cobia were also influenced significantly by water temperature and fish size. However, energy budgets were relatively constant over the 27-33 \textdegree C temperature and 70-200 g size ranges for cobia. Over the whole temperature and size ranges the proportion of food energy lost in feces and excretion for cobia was small (b 15\%) and a large proportion of food energy was allocated to growth and metabolism. The ratios of metabolism energy to assimilated energy (range: 57\textendash 84\%, average: 69\%) were much higher than the ratios of growth energy to assimilated energy. For cobia fast growth was attributable mainly to large food consumption though improved energy utilization with increased fish size at 27\textendash 33 \textdegree C made a certain contribution.},

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited. Many populations collapse suddenly when reaching low densities even if they have abundant food conditions, a phenomenon known as an Allee effect. Such collapses can have disastrous consequences, for example, for loss of biodiversity. In this paper, we formulate a stage-structured consumer-resource biomass model in which adults only reproduce at the beginning of each growing season, and investigate the effect of an increasing stage-independent background mortality rate of the consumer. As the main difference with previously studied continuous-time models, seasonal reproduction can result in an Allee effect and consumer population collapses at high consumer mortality rate. However, unlike the mechanisms reported in the literature, in our model the Allee effect results from the time difference between the maturation of juveniles and the reproduction of adults. The timing of maturation plays a crucial role because it not only determines the body size of the individuals at maturation but also influences the duration of the period during which adults can invest in reproductive energy, which together determine the reproductive output at the end of the season. We suggest that there exists an optimal timing of maturation and that consumer persistence is promoted if individuals mature later in the season at a larger body size, rather than maturing early, despite high food availability supporting rapid growth.}

  abstract = {The productivity of the Eastern Baltic cod (EBC) has been severely reduced over the last 25 years, for reasons that remain unclear. The size distribution of EBC has become increasingly truncated, condition and health status have deteriorated, and sexual maturation has started to occur at increasingly smaller sizes. Despite an increasing trend in recruitment during this period, reduced growth or increased mortality rates after the recruitment phase have resulted in decreasing landing levels and low profitability in the cod fishery, whereas the scientific community has difficulties in disentangling the causes of the decline of EBC. We studied changes in metabolic status in EBC between the capture years of 1995 and 2015, by investigating two aspects of fish metabolism that can be extracted retrospectively from otolith [earstone] morphometry and nitrogen content. Changes in relative otolith size to fish size are related to the metabolic history of the individual fish, and the otolith nitrogen content reveals the level of protein synthesis and feeding rate. Because otoliths accrue continuously on their surface and are biological stable (inert), the chemical content of the otolith trajectory reflects the timeline of the fish. We measured the N/Ca ratio as a proxy for protein content in EBC otolith along distal radius traverses from the core to the edge of the otolith by using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). Here we show that the otoliths have become smaller at a given fish size, and the ratio of N/Ca has increased over the studied period. These proxies reveal significant metabolic changes during the same period as the condition, and stock productivity has declined. We discuss potential mechanisms behind the metabolic changes, including elevated temperature and compensatory feeding due to nutrient deficiencies. Such changes in food quality may, in turn, relate to still unrecognized but on-going ecosystem shifts, where climate change could be the ultimate driver.},

Brander proposes in a comment to Sved\"ang~et al. that the observed trend in oxygen in SD 25 supports the idea that juvenile cod are balancing the physiological cost of living under mild hypoxia by offsetting the risk of being eaten by diving seals and cormorants in shallower water with more oxygen. There are a number of objections to this conjecture, besides the fact that supporting observations are missing. Hence, it is difficult to reconcile the long-term development of EBC under varying oxygen conditions with the hypothesis that a small reduction in oxygen content can explain the current strong and uniform decline in growth observed in the entire southern Baltic Sea.},

It has been proposed that both worsening conditions for reproduction and lower individual growth, condition, and survival are linked to hypoxia. Here, we elucidate the ecological envelope of EBC in terms of salinity stratification, oxygen content, and benthic animal biomasses, and how it has affected EBC productivity over time. The spawning conditions started deteriorating in the Gotland Deep in the 1950s~due to oxygen depletion. In contrast, in the Bornholm Basin, hydrographic conditions have remained unchanged over the last 60 years. Indeed, the current extent of both well-oxygenated areas and the frequency of hypoxia events do not differ substantially from periods with high EBC productivity in the 1970s\textendash 1980s.~Furthermore, oxygenated and therefore potentially suitable feeding areas are abundant in all parts of the Baltic Sea, and our novel analysis provides no evidence of a reduction in benthic food sources for EBC over the last 30 years. We find that while reproduction failure is intricately linked to hydrographic dynamics, a relationship between the spread of hypoxia and the decline in EBC productivity during the last decades cannot be substantiated.},

The predominant policy for remedying the world fishing crisis aims at maximum sustainable yield (MSY) by adjusting gear selectivity and fishing effort. Here we report a case study on how striving for higher yields from the Eastern Baltic cod stock by increasing selectivity has become exceedingly detrimental for its productivity. Although there is a successive increase in numbers of undersized fish, growth potential is severely reduced, and fishing mortality in fishable size has increased. Once density-dependent growth is introduced, the process is self-enforcing as long as the recruitment remains stable. Our findings suggest that policies focusing on maximum yield while targeting greater sizes are risky and should instead prioritize catch rates over yield. Disregarding the underlying population structure may jeopardize stock productivity, with dire consequences for the fishing industry and ecosystem structure and function.},

We examined the dynamics of depleted demersal fish populations in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, Canada. Twenty years ago, a number of these populations collapsed due to overexploitation. Since then, others have declined to low abundance. Despite negligible levels of fishing mortality and strong rates of production of small juvenile fish, these populations have shown no sign of recovery and some continue to decline. Lack of recovery is due to dramatic increases in the natural mortality of larger individuals in these populations. In some of these fishes, natural mortality has risen to levels typical of high-turnover forage fishes rather than long-lived demersal fishes. We hypothesize that these high levels of mortality reflect a `predator pit' or predation-driven Allee effect, resulting from the severely depleted abundance of these fishes and the high and rising abundance of their marine mammal predators, in particular grey seals. Recovery of collapsed demersal fish populations does not appear to be possible under current conditions in this ecosystem, even in the absence of fishing. Our results indicate a need for more precautionary management regimes in order to avoid population collapses that are not reversible by reducing exploitation.},

Although this practice may have negative effects on biodiversity and populations of individual species, it may also increase total fishery productivity by removing predatory fish. We examine the potential for this phenomenon to explain the high reported wild catches in the East China Sea-one of the most productive ecosystems in the world that has also had its catch reporting accuracy and fishery management questioned. We show that reported catches can be approximated using an ecosystem model that allows for trophic cascades (i.e., the depletion of predators and consequent increases in production of their prey). This would be the world's largest known example of marine ecosystem "engineering" and suggests that trade-offs between conservation and food production exist. We project that fishing practices could be modified to increase total catches, revenue, and biomass in the East China Sea, but single-species management would decrease both catches and revenue by reversing the trophic cascades. Our results suggest that implementing single-species management in currently lightly managed and highly exploited multispecies fisheries (which account for a large fraction of global fish catch) may result in decreases in global catch. Efforts to reform management in these fisheries will need to consider system wide impacts of changes in management, rather than focusing only on individual species.},

We find that the constant and slowly warming environments show similar responses in terms of population dynamics, whereas populations with linear and fast warming quickly decline and show a stronger temperature-size response. Our analyses suggest that acclimation may have played a role in observing these differences among treatments. The SD hypothesis is most parsimonious with the data, however, neither the DDG nor the MASROS hypothesis can be firmly dismissed.

It is not by chance that Japan, the country with one of the world's highest reported life expectancies and lowest incidences of obesity and deaths from heart related illnesses, is also one of the world's top consumers of captured and farmed aquatic animal food products and aquatic plants. According to the FAO, in 2009, total captured and farmed aquatic animal food products accounted for 16.6\% of the global population's intake of animal protein, providing more than three billion people with almost 20\% of their average per capita intake of animal protein, and 4.3 billion people with at least 15\% of such protein. This article reviews the nutritional composition of different farmed and captured aquatic food products and compares these with conventional terrestrial meat products. In addition to the superior nutritional profile and benefits of aquatic animal food products, small-sized marine pelagic fish play an important role in the nutrition of the poor as an affordable and much needed source of high quality animal protein and essential amino acids, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, minerals, and trace elements. As one of the best aquatic animal foods from a nutritional perspective, the direct consumption of small pelagic fish should be encouraged and promoted, as apposed to the continued targeted use of these species for reduction into fishmeal and fish oil for use in animal feeds.},

Juvenile P. flesus are important epibenthic predators on shallow sandy bottoms in this area, and play an important role in structuring benthic infaunal communities by both lethal and sublethal predation. These areas are affected by periodic oxygen deficiency during summer and autumn when drifting algal mats are abundant, which causes changes in both structure and function of the zoobenthic community. Experiments were performed to test for the effects of hypoxia on: (1) tolerance; (2) ventilation rate; (3) lethal predation efficiency; and (4) sublethal predation efficiency (siphon cropping) of P. flesus. In the lethal predation experiment, the amphipod Bathyporeia pilosa was used as prey, and in the siphon cropping experiment, the bivalve Macoma balthica was used. Recorded LT50 values of P. flesus exposed to hypoxia were 1835{$\pm$}87 (mean{$\pm$}SE) min at 20\%, 149{$\pm$}8 min at 10\% and 23{$\pm$}2 min at 5\% oxygen saturation (13\textdegree C, S 5\textperthousand ). In hypoxia, ventilation rate of P. flesus increased at 30\% and 20\%, and decreased at 10\% and 5\% oxygen saturation compared with normoxia. The predation efficiency of juvenile P. flesus was significantly lower at 20\% and 30\% compared with 40\% and 100\% oxygen saturation. In the sublethal predation experiment, the flounders cropped siphons most efficiently at moderate hypoxia (40\% oxygen saturation) compared with normoxia. Our results indicate that sublethal oxygen saturations (30\textendash 40\%) cause changes in physiology and predation behaviour of juvenile P. flesus. Such functional changes in benthic communities, at sublethal oxygen saturations, may influence the energy flow of benthic food webs in areas that are affected by periodic oxygen deficiency.},

However, the lack of explicit representation, analysis and consideration of uncertainty in most multispecies models has limited their application in analyses that could support management advice. * We assessed the consequences of parameter uncertainty by developing 78 125 multispecies size-structured fish community models, with all combinations of parameters drawn from ranges that spanned parameter values estimated from data and literature. This unfiltered ensemble was reduced to 188 plausible models, the filtered ensemble (FE), by screening outputs against fish abundance data and ecological principles such as requiring species' persistence. * Effects of parameter uncertainty on estimates of single-species management reference points for fishing mortality (FMSY, fishing mortality rate providing MSY, the maximum sustainable yield) and biomass (BMSY, biomass at MSY) were evaluated by calculating probability distributions of estimated reference points with the FE. There was a 50\% probability that multispecies FMSY could be estimated to within {$\pm$}25\% of its actual value, and a 50\% probability that BMSY could be estimated to within {$\pm$}40\% of its actual value. * Signal-to-noise ratio was assessed for four community indicators when mortality rates were reduced from current rates to FMSY. The slope of the community size spectrum showed the greatest signal-to-noise ratio, indicating that it would be the most responsive indicator to the change in fishing mortality F. Further, the power of an ongoing international monitoring survey to detect predicted responses of size spectrum slope was higher than for other size-based metrics. * Synthesis and applications: Application of the ensemble model approach allows explicit representation of parameter uncertainty and supports advice and management by (i) providing uncertainty intervals for management reference points, (ii) estimating working values of reference points that achieve a defined reduction in risk of not breaching the true reference point, (iii) estimating the responsiveness of population, community, food web and biodiversity indicators to changes in F, (iv) assessing the performance of indicators and monitoring programmes and (v) identifying priorities for data collection and changes to model structure to reduce uncertainty.},

Information regarding animal movement can be obtained from selection experiments, tagging studies, flux through movement gates (e.g. acoustic arrays), fishery catch-per-unit effort (CPUE), resource surveys and genetic/chemical markers. However, there are few accessible approaches to combine these data types while accounting for spatially correlated residual patterns. We therefore discuss a movement model involving diffusion (random movement), taxis (movement towards preferred habitat) and advection (passive drift following ocean currents). We specifically outline how these movement processes can be fitted to data while discretizing space and time and estimating non-linear habitat preferences using environmental layers as well as spatial process errors. Finally, we introduce an R package, ATM, by fitting the model to bottom trawl survey, longline fishery and tagging data for Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus, Gadidae) in the Bering Sea during winter/summer seasons from 1982 to 2019. Combining data types predicts an increasing proportion of cod residing in the northern Bering Sea from 2013 to 2019, and estimates are informative in a recent stock assessment model. We fit sensitivity analyses by dropping tag, survey or fishery data, and this analysis shows that tagging data are necessary to identify diffusion rates, while survey data are informative about movement among biogeographic strata. This ``hybrid'' species distribution model can help explain poleward movement, project distributions under future climate conditions and evaluate alternative tag-deployment scenarios to optimize tagging designs.},

  abstract = {Niche-based approaches to community analysis often involve estimating a matrix of pairwise interactions among species (the ``community matrix''), but this task becomes infeasible using observational data as the number of modeled species increases. As an alternative, neutral theories achieve parsimony by assuming that species within a trophic level are exchangeable, but generally cannot incorporate stabilizing interactions even when they are evident in field data. Finally, both regulated (niche) and unregulated (neutral) approaches have rarely been fitted directly to survey data using spatiotemporal statistical methods. We therefore propose a spatiotemporal and model-based approach to estimate community dynamics that are partially regulated. Specifically, we start with a neutral spatiotemporal model where all species follow ecological drift, which precludes estimating pairwise interactions. We then add regulatory relations until model selection favors stopping, where the ``rank'' of the interaction matrix may range from zero to the number of species. A simulation experiment shows that model selection can accurately identify the rank of the interaction matrix, and that the identified spatiotemporal model can estimate the magnitude of species interactions. A 40-yr case study for the Gulf of St. Lawrence marine community shows that recovering grey seals have an unregulated and negative relationship with demersal fishes. We therefore conclude that partial regulation is a plausible approximation to community dynamics using field data and hypothesize that estimating partial regulation will be expedient in future analyses of spatiotemporal community dynamics given limited field data. We conclude by recommending ongoing research to add explicit models for movement, so that meta-community theory can be confronted with data in a spatiotemporal statistical framework.},

We next discuss analytical approaches to address each difficulty, respectively: (i) ongoing developments for spatial demographic models; (ii) individual movement models and rank-reduction approaches to identify regional variability; (iii) causal analysis involving structural equation models. We demonstrate nonlocal effects in detail using a diffusion-taxis movement model applied to sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) in the Gulf of Alaska and discuss all three approaches for deep-sea corals. Despite isolated progress to resolve individual difficulties, we argue that resolving this Grand Habitat Challenge will require a coordinated commitment from science agencies worldwide.},

  abstract = {Fisheries scientists provide stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments to support interdisplinary fisheries management in the US and worldwide. These assessment activities have evolved different models, using different review standards, and are communicated using different vocabulary. Recent research shows that spatio-temporal models can estimate population density for multiple locations, times, and species, and that this is a ``common currency'' for addressing core goals in stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments. I therefore review the history and ``design principles'' for one spatio-temporal modelling package, the Vector Autoregressive SpatioTemporal (VAST) package. I then provide guidance on fifteen major decisions that must be made by users of VAST, including: whether to use a univariate or multivariate model; when to include spatial and/or spatiotemporal variation; how many factors to use within a multivariate model; whether to include density or catchability covariates; and when to include a temporal correlation on model components. I finally demonstrate these decisions using three case studies. The first develops indices of abundance, distribution shift, and range expansion for arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias) in the Eastern Bering Sea, showing the range expansion for this species. The second involves ``species ordination'' of eight groundfishes in the Gulf of Alaska bottom trawl survey, which highlights the different spatial distribution of flathead sole (Hippoglossoides elassodon) relative to sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) and dover sole (Microstomus pacificus). The third involves a short-term forecast of the proportion of coastwide abundance for five groundfishes within three spatial strata in the US West Coast groundfish bottom trawl survey, and predicts large interannual variability (and high uncertainty) in the distribution of lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus). I conclude by recommending further research exploring the benefits and limitations of a ``common currency'' approach to stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments, and discuss extending this approach to optimal survey design and economic assessments.},

We therefore developed a hierarchical model for recruitment variability and autocorrelation and applied it to data for 154 fish populations. Results were similar when using either the Ricker or Beverton\textendash Holt stock\textendash recruitment model, and showed that autocorrelated recruitment has a marginal standard deviation of 0.74 (SD = 0.35) and a mean autocorrelation of 0.43 (SD = 0.28) when predicting for an unobserved taxonomic order. Estimates differed somewhat among taxonomic orders and stocks, and also supported a hypothesized positive relationship between age at maturity and autocorrelation in recruitment. Our results can be used as a Bayesian prior for recruitment variability in models for data-poor stocks and to distinguish recruitment from other process errors in models for data-rich stocks. Estimates can also be used in the design of future simulation models and management strategy evaluations and in theoretical research regarding life history variation.},

Ecologists have aimed to estimate density dependence in population and community data by fitting a simple autoregressive (Gompertz) model for density dependence to time series of abundance for an entire population. However, it is increasingly recognized that spatial heterogeneity in population densities has implications for population and community dynamics. We therefore adapt the Gompertz model to approximate local densities over continuous space instead of population-wide abundance, and allow productivity to vary spatially using Gaussian random fields. We then show that the conventional (nonspatial) Gompertz model can result in biased estimates of density dependence (e.g., identifying oscillatory dynamics when not present) if densities vary spatially. By contrast, the spatial Gompertz model provides accurate and precise estimates of density dependence for a variety of simulation scenarios and data availabilities. These results are corroborated when comparing spatial and nonspatial models for data from 10 years and 100 sampling stations for three long-lived rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) off the California, USA coast. In this case, the nonspatial model estimates implausible oscillatory dynamics on an annual time scale, while the spatial model estimates strong autocorrelation and is supported by model selection tools. We conclude by discussing the importance of improved data archiving techniques, so that spatial models can be used to reexamine classic questions regarding the existence and magnitude of density dependence in wild populations.},

  abstract = {Aim Spatial analysis of the distribution and density of species is of continuing interest within theoretical and applied ecology. Species distribution models (SDMs) are being increasingly used to analyse count, presence\textendash absence and presence-only data sets. There is a growing literature on dynamic SDMs (which incorporate temporal variation in species distribution), joint SDMs (which simultaneously analyse the correlated distribution of multiple species) and geostatistical models (which account for similarity between nearby sites caused by unobserved covariates). However, no previous study has combined all three attributes within a single framework. Innovation We develop spatial dynamic factor analysis for use as a `joint, dynamic SDM' (JDSDM), which uses geostatistical methods to account for spatial similarity when estimating one or more `factors'. Each factor evolves over time following a density-dependent (Gompertz) process, and the log-density of each species is approximated as a linear combination of different factors. We demonstrate a JDSDM using two multispecies case studies (an annual survey of bottom-associated species in the Bering Sea and a seasonal survey of butterfly density in the continental USA), and also provide our code publicly as an R package. Main conclusions Case study applications show that that JDSDMs can be used for species ordination, i.e. showing that dynamics for butterfly species within the same genus are significantly more correlated than for species from different genera. We also demonstrate how JDSDMs can rapidly identify dominant patterns in community dynamics, including the decline and recovery of several Bering Sea fishes since 2008, and the `flight curves' typical of early or late-emerging butterflies. We conclude by suggesting future research that could incorporate phylogenetic relatedness or functional similarity, and propose that our approach could be used to monitor community dynamics at large spatial and temporal scales.},

However, these indices are rarely included in the species distribution models that are used to identify and forecast distribution shifts under future climate scenarios. I therefore review three interpretations of spatially varying coefficient models, explain how they can be used to estimate spatial patterns of population density associated with oceanographic indices, and add this option to the multivariate spatiotemporal model VAST. I then use a case study involving bottom trawl data for 17 fish and decapod species in the eastern Bering Sea 1982\textendash 2017 to answer: does a spatially varying coefficient model for CPE explain variation in spatial distribution for species in this region? And (2) does a spatially varying effect of CPE remain substantial even when local temperature is also included as a covariate? Results show that CPE and local bottom temperature are both identified as parsimonious by Akaike Information Criterion for 13 of 17 species, jointly explain nearly 9\%\textendash 14\% of spatiotemporal variation on average, and CPE does explain variation in excess of local temperature alone. I therefore conclude that spatially varying coefficient models are a useful way to assimilate oceanographic indices within species distribution models, and hypothesize that these will be useful to account for decadal-scale variability within multidecadal forecasts of distribution shift.},

  abstract = {Changing climate is already impacting the spatial distribution of many taxa, including bees, plants, birds, butterflies and fishes. A common goal is to detect range shifts in response to climate change, including changes in the centre of the population's distribution (the centre of gravity, COG), population boundaries and area occupied. Conventional estimators, such as the abundance-weighted average (AWA) estimator for COG, confound range shifts with changes in the spatial distribution of available survey data and may be biased when the distribution of survey data shifts over time. AWA also does not estimate the standard error of COG in individual years and cannot incorporate data from multiple survey designs. To explicitly account for changes in the spatial distribution of survey effort, we propose an alternative species distribution function (SDF) estimator. The SDF approach involves calculating distribution metrics, including COG, population boundary and area occupied, directly from the predicted species distribution or density function. We illustrate the SDF approach using a spatiotemporal model that is available as an r package. Using simulated data, we confirm that the SDF substantially decreases bias in COG estimates relative to the AWA estimator. We then illustrate the method by analysing data from two data sets spanning 1977\textendash 2013 for 18 marine fishes along the U.S. West Coast. In our case study, the SDF estimator shows significant northward shifts for six of 18 species (with southward shifts for only 2), where two species (darkblotched and greenstriped rockfishes) have both a northward shift and a decreased area occupied. Pelagic species (e.g. Pacific hake and spiny dogfish) have more variable distribution than bottom-associated species. We also find substantial differences between AWA and SDF estimates of COG that are likely caused by shifts in sampling distribution (which affect the AWA but not the SDF estimator). We caution that common estimators for range shift can yield inappropriate inference whenever sampling designs have shifted over time. We conclude by suggesting further improvements in model-based approaches to analysing climate impacts, including methods addressing the impact of local and regional temperature changes on species distribution.},

Demographic parameters representing individual growth, maturity, mortality, and recruitment have previously been documented to change over decadal time scales. However, there has been relatively little comparison regarding which vital rates cause relatively greater or lesser impacts on commonly used fisheries management targets. We therefore use a life table (based on age-structured assessment models) to explore the sensitivity of fishing mortality, spawning biomass, and catch targets to changes in parameters representing growth, mortality, recruitment, and maturation rates for three representative life histories representing long-, medium-, and short-lived species. The elasticity analysis indicates that demographic changes can result in substantial variation in fisheries management targets, but that changes in mortality rates are particularly important for spawning biomass and catch targets while maturity and recruitment compensation are also important for fishing mortality targets. We conclude by discussing the importance of improved data repositories to address covariation among maturity, growth, and mortality parameters.},

For over 100 years, scientists have identified ``life history invariants'' (LHI) representing pairs of parameters whose ratio is theorized to be constant across species. LHI then promise to allow prediction of many parameters from field measurements of a few important traits. Using LHI in this way, however, neglects any residual patterns in parameters when making predictions. We therefore apply a multivariate model for eight variables (seven parameters and temperature) in over 32,000 fishes, and include taxonomic structure for residuals (with levels for class, order, family, genus, and species). We illustrate that this approach predicts variables probabilistically for taxa with many or few data. We then use this model to resolve three questions regarding life history parameters in fishes. Specifically we show that (1) on average there is a 1.24\% decrease in the Brody growth coefficient for every 1\% increase in maximum size; (2) the ratio of natural mortality rate and growth coefficient is not an LHI but instead varies systematically based on the timing of maturation, where movement along this life history axis is predictably correlated with species taxonomy; and (3) three variables must be known per species to precisely predict remaining life history variables. We distribute our predictive model as an R package, FishLife, to allow future life history predictions for fishes to be conditioned on taxonomy and life history data for fishes worldwide. This package also contains predictions (and predictive intervals) for mortality, maturity, size, and growth parameters for all described fishes.},

Analysts have then projected future water temperatures to forecast shifts in COG, but often neglected to demonstrate that temperature explains a substantial portion of historical distribution shifts. We argue that estimating the proportion of observed distributional shifts that can be attributed to temperature vs. other factors is a critical first step in forecasting future changes. We illustrate this approach using Gadus chalcogrammus (Walleye pollock) in the Eastern Bering Sea, and use a vector-\-autoregressive spatiotemporal model to attribute variation in COG from 1982 to 2015 to three factors: local or regional changes in surface and bottom temperature (``temperature effects''), fluctuations in size-\- structure that cause COG to be skewed towards juvenile or adult habitats (``size-\- structured effects'') or otherwise unexplained spatiotemporal variation in distribution (``unexplained effects''). We find that the majority of variation in COG (including the north-\-west trend since 1982) is largely unexplained by temperature or size-s\- tructured effects. Temperature alone generates a small portion of primarily north\textendash south variation in COG, while size-\-structured effects generate a small portion of east\textendash west variation. We therefore conclude that projections of future distribution based on temperature alone are likely to miss a substantial portion of both the interannual variation and interdecadal trends in COG for this species. More generally, we suggest that decomposing variation in COG into multiple causal factors is a vital first step for projecting likely impacts of temperature change.},

Species distributions can be estimated using geostatistical methods, which estimate a latent spatial variable explaining observed variation in densities, but geostatistical methods may be imprecise for species with low densities or few observations. Additionally, simple geostatistical methods fail to account for correlations in distribution among species and generally estimate such cross-correlations as a post hoc exercise. We therefore present spatial factor analysis (SFA), a spatial model for estimating a low-rank approximation to multivariate data, and use it to jointly estimate the distribution of multiple species simultaneously. We also derive an analytic estimate of cross-correlations among species from SFA parameters. As a first example, we show that distributions for 10 bird species in the breeding bird survey in 2012 can be parsimoniously represented using only five spatial factors. As a second case study, we show that forward prediction of catches for 20 rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) off the U.S. West Coast is more accurate using SFA than analysing each species individually. Finally, we show that single-species models give a different picture of cross-correlations than joint estimation using SFA. Spatial factor analysis complements a growing list of tools for jointly modelling the distribution of multiple species and provides a parsimonious summary of cross-correlation without requiring explicit declaration of habitat variables. We conclude by proposing future research that would model species cross-correlations using dissimilarity of species? traits, and the development of spatial dynamic factor analysis for a low-rank approximation to spatial time-series data.},

Spatial or temporal variation in condition can contribute to otherwise unexplained variation in the relationship between spawning biomass and recruitment. Individual condition is also included in age-structured population models, which use weight at age to convert population estimates between numbers and biomass. However, no study has analyzed spatial and temporal variation in condition for multiple marine species. Here I apply recent improvements in spatial modeling to analyze coastwide variation in condition for 28 groundfishes in the California Current. I show that, on average, 22\% of individual-level variation in condition can be explained via persistent (constant over time) and annually varying spatial differences in condition, and condition for many species varies 10 to 20\% spatially and among years. While population density, bottom temperature, and calendar date are parsimonious descriptors of condition in several species, the sign of these coefficients varies, and their magnitude is small relative to the magnitude of residual spatial and temporal variation. Additionally, annually varying spatial differences have nearly twice the magnitude of persistent spatial differences in condition. I therefore conclude that dynamic habitat conditions contribute a substantial portion of variation in individual condition for these groundfishes. Spatial and temporal variation in condition will be important for population models that convert between numbers, fishery catch, and population biomass, and may also clarify unexplained variability in productivity for marine fishes.},

  abstract = {Protected and managed species, including harvested fishes, exhibit spatial and temporal variation in their distribution and productivity. Spatio-temporal variation can arise from differences in habitat quality, human impacts (including harvest), density-dependent changes in per capita productivity, as well as individual movement. Human impacts (e.g. direct harvest) also vary spatially and over time, and monitoring the overlap between impacts and population distribution is necessary to ensure that human impacts are sustainable and to prioritize research and management for populations that are heavily impacted. However, estimating spatio-temporal variation in human impacts and population dynamics while accounting for individual movement has remained computationally challenging for decades. We developed a spatial population growth (also known as `surplus production') model that is inspired by finite element analysis, which estimates spatio-temporal population dynamics given density-dependent population regulation, individual movement and spatially explicit harvest. We demonstrate the method using data for big skate Raja binoculata in the California Current from 2003 to 2013 and demonstrate that results can be processed to estimate an upper limit on sustainable harvest (an `overfishing limit'). We also conduct a simulation experiment to explore the small-sample properties of parameter estimates. A simulation experiment confirms that real-world sample sizes are sufficient to estimate the sustainable harvest level within 20\% of its actual value. However, sample sizes are likely insufficient to reliably estimate movement rates. The spatial population growth model estimates an overfishing limit of 740\textendash 890 metric tonnes for big skate from 2010 to 2013, compared with annual harvest {$<$}100 tonnes. This suggests that recent harvest of big skate is likely sustainable, and sensitivity analysis confirms that this conclusion is robust to different potential rates for individual movement. Synthesis and applications. We recommend that spatio-temporal population models be used across systems and taxa to monitor the spatial overlap between species distribution and human impacts. For big skate, we recommend management rules triggering additional data collection and assessment effort if harvest rates substantially increase. We also recommend future research regarding spatial management regulations for emerging fisheries.},

  abstract = {Species interactions mediate how warming affects community composition via individual growth and population size structure. While predictions on how warming affects composition of size- or stage-structured communities have so far focused on linear (food chain) communities, mixed competition-predation interactions, such as intraguild predation, are common. Intraguild predation often results from changes in diet over ontogeny (``ontogenetic diet shifts'') and strongly affects community composition and dynamics. Here, we study how warming affects a community of intraguild predators with ontogenetic diet shifts, consumers, and shared prey by analyzing a stage-structured bioenergetics multispecies model with temperature- and body size\textendash dependent individual-level rates. We find that warming can strengthen competition and decrease predation, leading to a loss of a cultivation mechanism (the feedback between predation on and competition with consumers exerted by predators) and ultimately predator collapse. Furthermore, we show that the effect of warming on community composition depends on the extent of the ontogenetic diet shift and that warming can cause a sequence of community reconfigurations in species with partial diet shifts. Our findings contrast previous predictions concerning individual growth of predators and the mechanisms behind predator loss in warmer environments and highlight how feedbacks between temperature and intraspecific size structure are important for understanding such effects on community composition.},

Considerable knowledge has been established on how such effects can affect population growth and size structure, but less is known of their potential role in temperature-driven adaptation in life-history traits. In this study, we ask how warming affects the optimal allocation of energy between growth and reproduction and disentangle the underlying fitness trade-offs. To this end, we develop a novel dynamic energy budget integral projection model (DEB\textendash IPM), linking individuals' size- and temperature-dependent consumption and maintenance via somatic growth, reproduction, and size-dependent energy allocation to emergent population responses. At the population level, we calculate the long-term population growth rate (fitness) and stable size structure emerging from demographic processes. Applying the model to an example of pike (Esox lucius), we find that optimal energy allocation to growth decreases with warming. Furthermore, we demonstrate how growth, fecundity, and survival contribute to this change in optimal allocation. Higher energy allocation to somatic growth at low temperatures increases fitness through survival of small individuals and through the reproduction of larger individuals. In contrast, at high temperatures, increased allocation to reproduction is favored because warming induces faster somatic growth of small individuals and increased fecundity but reduced growth and higher mortality of larger individuals. Reduced optimum allocation to growth leads to further reductions in body size and an increasingly truncated population size structure with warming. Our study demonstrates how, by incorporating general physiological mechanisms driving the temperature dependence of life-history traits, the DEB\textendash IPM framework is useful for investigating the adaptation of size-structured organisms to warming.},

For such models, the important step of model validation rarely receives as much attention as estimation or hypothesis testing, perhaps due to lack of available algorithms and software. Model validation is often based on a naive adaptation of Pearson residuals, i.e. the difference between observations and posterior means, even if this approach is flawed. Here, we consider validation of state space models through one-step prediction errors, and discuss principles and practicalities arising when the model has been fitted with a tool for estimation in general mixed effects models. Implementing one-step predictions in the R package Template Model Builder, we demonstrate that it is possible to perform model validation with little effort, even if the ecological model is multivariate, has non-linear dynamics, and whether observations are continuous or discrete. With both simulated data, and a real data set related to geolocation of seals, we demonstrate both the potential and the limitations of the techniques. Our results fill a need for convenient methods for validating a state space model, or alternatively, rejecting it while indicating useful directions in which the model could be improved.},

  abstract = {Joint species distribution models (JSDM) are increasingly used to analyse community ecology data. Recent progress with JSDMs has provided ecologists with new tools for estimating species associations (residual co-occurrence patterns after accounting for environmental niches) from large data sets, as well as for increasing the predictive power of species distribution models (SDMs) by accounting for such associations. Yet, one critical limitation of JSDMs developed thus far is that they assume constant species associations. However, in real ecological communities, the direction and strength of interspecific interactions are likely to be different under different environmental conditions. In this paper, we overcome the shortcoming of present JSDMs by allowing species associations covary with measured environmental covariates. To estimate environmental-dependent species associations, we utilize a latent variable structure, where the factor loadings are modelled as a linear regression to environmental covariates. We illustrate the performance of the statistical framework with both simulated and real data. Our results show that JSDMs perform substantially better in inferring environmental-dependent species associations than single SDMs, especially with sparse data. Furthermore, JSDMs consistently overperform SDMs in terms of predictive power for generating predictions that account for environment-dependent biotic associations. We implemented the statistical framework as a MATLAB package, which includes tools both for model parameterization as well as for post-processing of results, particularly for addressing whether and how species associations depend on the environmental conditions. Our statistical framework provides a new tool for ecologists who wish to investigate from non-manipulative observational community data the dependency of interspecific interactions on environmental context. Our method can be applied to answer the fundamental questions in community ecology about how species' interactions shift in changing environmental conditions, as well as to predict future changes of species' interactions in response to global change.},

The experiment was design as a completely randomized factorial arrangement (5x3x3), using a respirometer of 20 L and a water recirculation pump. CO measurements were recorded every 5 min by using a digital oximeter. It was shown that the CO maintains interaction with body weight (P) and water temperature (T) (P {$<$} 0.05). The results indicate that CO remains directly related to water temperature and inversely with body weight of the organisms. The regression between independent variables and CO were adjusted to potential equations: CO = 2844.9 P-0.734, CO = 2555.9 P-0.624 and CO = 1945.4 P-0.507 for 21, 26 y 31\textdegree C respectively; where P expressed in kg, yielding high coefficients of correlation and determination. The resulting equation of the multivariate regression analysis was: CO = 4.839 - (0.706* P) + (9.106* T). The results provide information to estimate the capacity in an aquaculture environment based upon the oxygen demand of C. macropomum, contributing to the development of aquaculture with greater technical support.},

We identified a series of ecosystem regime shifts in the 1930s, 1970s, and at the end of the 1980s/beginning of the 1990s.

Our analysis shows that for the entire time period, productivity, climate, and hydrography mainly affected the functioning of the food web, whereas fishing became important more recently. Eutrophication had far-reaching direct and indirect impacts from a long-term perspective and changed not only the trophic state of the system but also affected higher trophic levels.

In such life-history intraguild predation (LHIGP) systems, prey can therefore also regulate the recruitment and thus population dynamics of their predator via competition. Theory predicts that such stage-structured systems exhibit a wide range of dynamics, including alternative stable states. Here we show that cannibalism is an exceedingly common interaction within natural LHIGP systems that determines what coexistence states are possible. Using a modeling approach that simulates a range of ontogenetic diet shift scenarios along a productivity gradient, we demonstrate that only if the predator is competitively dominant can cannibalism promote coexistence by allowing prey to persist. If the prey is competitively dominant, cannibalism instead results in competitive exclusion of the predator and the loss of potential alternative stable states. Further, predator exclusion occurs at low cannibalistic preference relative to empirical estimates and is consistent across LHIGP systems in which the predator undergoes a complete diet shift or diet broadening over ontogeny. Given that prey is frequently competitively dominant in natural systems, our results demonstrate that even weak cannibalism can inhibit predator persistence, prompting exploration of mechanisms that reconcile theory with the common occurrence of such interactions in nature.},

However, further development and refinement of techniques applicable for field-based studies on free swimming animals would greatly enhance the capacity to study fish under environmentally relevant conditions. In an effort to foster discussion in this area, from field ecologists to biochemists alike, we review aspects of energy metabolism and give details on approaches that have been used to estimate energetic parameters in fishes. In some cases, the techniques have been applied to field conditions; while in others, the methods have been primarily used on laboratory held fishes but should be applicable, with validation, to fishes in their natural environment. Limitations, experimental considerations and caveats of these measurements and the study of metabolism in wild fishes in general are also discussed. Potential novel approaches to FMR estimates are also presented for consideration. The innovation of methods for measuring field metabolic rate in free-ranging wild fish would revolutionize the study of physiological ecology.},

This method requires the determination of fish age, size, and growth and Hg concentration in fish and their food. The model was validated using data obtained from a previously published laboratory experiment. A field test of the model showed that food consumption rates determined with the Hg mass balance model differed from independent estimates obtained with the 137Cs method by only 0.6\textendash 16.1\%. The model was applied to fish from various lakes in Quebec and Ontario. Food consumption rates estimated with the Hg mass balance model varied significantly both among species and among populations. Furthermore, female fish tended to eat 30\textendash 40\% more food than males, probably to meet the larger energy requirement associated with egg production. A sensitivity analysis indicated that the Hg mass balance model was mostly responsive to variables that can be easily measured in the field, such as fish size and Hg concentration in fish and their food. By providing a low-effort approach to quantifying food consumption rates of fish in the field, this method may help to refine our understanding of the environmental factors that influence the quantity of food consumed by fish.},

Laboratory data from broad taxonomic groups suggest that a widespread response to a warming world may be an overall decrease in organism body size. However, given the myriad of biotic and abiotic factors that can also influence organism body size in the wild, it is unclear whether results from these laboratory assays hold in nature. Here we use datasets spanning 30 to 100 years to examine whether the body size of wild-caught beetles has changed over time, whether body size changes are correlated with increased temperatures, and we frame these results using predictions derived from a quantitative review of laboratory responses of 22 beetle species to temperature. We found that 95\% of laboratory-reared beetles decreased in size with increased rearing temperature, with larger-bodied species shrinking disproportionately more than smaller-bodied beetles. In addition, the museum datasets revealed that larger-bodied beetle species have decreased in size over time, that mean beetle body size explains much of the interspecific variation in beetle responses to temperature, and that long-term beetle size changes are explained by increases in autumn temperature and decreases in spring temperature in this region. Our data demonstrate that the relationship between body size and temperature of wild-caught beetles matches relatively well with results from laboratory studies, and that variation in this relationship is largely explained by interspecific variation in mean beetle body size. This long-term beetle dataset is one of the most comprehensive arthropod body size datasets compiled to date, it improves predictions regarding the shrinking of organisms with global climate change, and together with the meta-analysis data, call for new hypotheses to explain why larger-bodied organisms may be more sensitive to temperature.},

Organisms regularly interact with other species, yet whether climate-mediated evolution can occur in the context of species interactions is not well understood. We tested whether a species interaction could modify evolutionary responses to temperature. We demonstrate that predation pressure by Dipteran larvae (Chaoborus americanus) modified the evolutionary response of a freshwater crustacean (Daphnia pulex) to its thermal environment over approximately seven generations in laboratory conditions. Daphnia kept at 21 degrees C evolved higher population growth rates than those kept at 18 degrees C, but only in those populations that were also reared with predators. Furthermore, predator-mediated selection resulted in the evolution of elevated Daphnia thermal plasticity. This laboratory natural selection experiment demonstrates that biotic interactions can modify evolutionary adaptation to temperature. Understanding the interplay between multiple selective forces can improve predictions of ecological and evolutionary responses of organisms to rapid environmental change.},

Size distribution of an exploited stock is predicted to shift toward small individuals caused by size-selective fishing and/or warming; however, their relative contribution remains relatively unexplored. In addition, existing analyses on size structure have focused on univariate size-based indicators (SBIs), such as mean length, evenness of size classes, or the upper 95-percentile of the length frequency distribution; these approaches may not capture full information of size structure. To bridge the gap, we used the variation partitioning approach to examine how the size structure (composition of size classes) responded to fishing, warming and the interaction. We analyzed 28 exploited stocks in the West US, Alaska and North Sea. Our result shows fishing has the most prominent effect on the size structure of the exploited stocks. In addition, the fish stocks experienced higher variability in fishing is more responsive to the~temperature effect in their size structure, suggesting that fishing may elevate the sensitivity of exploited stocks in responding to environmental effects. The~variation partitioning approach provides complementary information to univariate SBIs in analyzing size structure.},

  abstract = {Climate-driven species redistribution is pervasive and accelerating, yet the complex mechanisms at play remain poorly understood. The implications of large-scale species redistribution for natural systems and human societies have resulted in a large number of studies exploring the effects on individual species and ecological communities worldwide. Whilst many studies have investigated discrete components of species redistribution, the integration required for a more complete mechanistic understanding is lacking. In this paper, we provide a framework for synthesising approaches to more robustly understand and predict marine species redistributions. We conceptualise the stages and processes involved in climate-driven species redistribution at increasing levels of biological organisation, and synthesize the laboratory, field and modelling approaches used to study redistribution related processes at individual, population and community levels. We then summarise links between scales of biological organisation and methodological approaches in a hierarchical framework that represents an integrated mechanistic assessment of climate-driven species redistributions. In a rapidly expanding field of research, this framework provides direction for: 1) guiding future research, 2) highlighting key knowledge gaps, 3) fostering data exchange and collaboration between disciplines and 4) improving shared capacity to predict and therefore, inform the proactive management of climate impacts on natural systems.},

Here, we investigated the effect of increased seawater temperatures on the metabolic and consumption rates of five distinct marine species. The experimental species reflected different trophic positions within a typical benthic East Atlantic food web, and included a herbivorous gastropod, a scavenging decapod, a predatory echinoderm, a decapod and a benthic-feeding fish. We examined the metabolism-body mass and consumption-body mass scaling for each species, and assessed changes in their consumption efficiencies. Our results indicate that body mass and temperature effects on metabolism were inconsistent across species and that some species were unable to meet metabolic demand at higher temperatures, thus highlighting the vulnerability of individual species to warming. While body size explains a large proportion of the variation in species' physiological responses to warming, it is clear that idiosyncratic species responses, irrespective of body size, complicate predictions of population and ecosystem level response to future scenarios of climate change.},

Despite extensive research looking at the factors underlying foraging interactions, there remains ongoing controversy about how temperature and body size control the functional response parameters space clearance (or attack) rate and handling time. Here, we investigate the effects of temperature, consumer mass, and resource mass using the largest compilation of functional responses yet assembled. This compilation contains 2,083 functional response curves covering a wide range of foragers and prey types, environmental conditions, and habitats. After accounting for experimental arena size, dimensionality of the foraging interaction, and consumer taxon, we find that both space clearance rate and handling time are optimized at intermediate temperatures (a unimodal rather than monotonic response), suggesting that the response to global climate change depends on the location of the consumer's current temperature relative to the optimum. We further confirm that functional responses are higher and steeper for large consumers and small resources, and models using consumer and resource masses separately outperformed models using consumer:resource mass ratios, suggesting that consumer and resource body mass act independently to set interaction strengths. Lastly, we show that the extent to which foraging is affected by temperature or mass depends on the taxonomic identity of the consumer and the dimensionality of the consumer-resource interaction. We thus argue that although overall body size and temperature effects can be identified, they are not universal, and therefore food web and community modeling approaches could be improved by considering taxonomic identity along with body size and unimodal temperature effects.},

In particular, it is unclear if expected body size shrinkage in response to warming, observed at the interspecific level, can be used to infer similar size shifts within species. In this study, we compare warming effects on interspecific (relative species abundance) versus intraspecific (relative stage abundance) size structure of competing consumers by analyzing stage-structured bioenergetic food web models consisting of one or two consumer species and two resources, parameterized for pelagic plankton. Varying composition and temperature and body size dependencies in these models, we predicted interspecific versus intraspecific size structure across temperature. We found that warming shifted community size structure toward dominance of smaller species, in line with empirical evidence summarized in our review of 136 literature studies. However, this result emerged only given a size\textendash temperature interaction favoring small over large individuals in warm environments. In contrast, the same mechanism caused an intraspecific shift toward dominance of larger (adult) stages, reconciling disparate observations of size responses within and across zooplankton species in the literature. As the empirical evidence for warming-driven stage shifts is scarce and equivocal, we call for more experimental studies on intraspecific size changes with warming. Understanding the global warming impacts on animal communities requires that we consider and quantify the relative importance of mechanisms concurrently shaping size distributions within and among species.},

We also test for changes over time in stomach fullness, diet, condition factor and body length. There was a clear reduction in condition factor for post-smolts sampled in the Norwegian Sea in the period 2003\textendash 2012. The post-smolt stomach fullness was also reduced in the same period. The reduction in condition factor is partly explained by reduced stomach fullness, including a reduction of highly energetic fish larvae and Amphipoda in the diet. Feeding on other prey, such as meso-zooplankton and insects, cannot substitute the high-quality fish larvae and Amphipoda in the post-smolt diet. This is the first study to document how salmon post-smolts feeding in the Norwegian Sea are affected by reduced feeding conditions. Possible causes for the observed changes in post-smolt feeding are ocean warming, decreased primary productivity, and reduced recruitment of important fish larvae.},

As expected based on environmental gradients, herring grew faster in southern than in northern areas. The condition factor for young individuals was higher in the north, but higher for older individuals in the south. Probabilistic maturation reaction norms (PMRNs) based on age, length and condition indicated counter-gradient variation: young herring in the northern areas reached the size at which they had a 50\% probability of maturing when they were comparatively smaller than the southern specimens. However, the north\textendash south differences in PMRNs were reversed in older age groups. This indicated that maturation of herring in the north was more size dependent (zero PMRN slope) than it was for herring in the south, where maturation was predominantly determined by age (negative PMRN slope). The geographical differentiation in maturation schedules would potentially translated into divergent changes in recruitment in response to changes in density-dependent growth and, hence, also fishing patterns.},

The model is used to predict temperature-dependent size variation of ectotherms at maturation as a result of the interaction of growth and differentiation. It is shown that the difference between the activation energy constants of growth and differentiation determines the slope of the size-temperature reaction norm. The structural and heritable variation in enzymes determines reaction norm shape without inferring regulatory genes. All thermodynamic parameters of the Sharpe-Schoolfield equation can be estimated empirically with non-linear regression techniques. The biophysical model provides a proximate framework for genotypic models of reaction norm evolution; genetic variation in either growth or differentiation would lead to genotype by environment interaction.

  abstract = {Current predictions on species responses to climate change strongly rely on projecting altered environmental conditions on species distributions. However, it is increasingly acknowledged that climate change also influences species interactions. We review and synthesize literature information on biotic interactions and use it to argue that the abundance of species and the direction of selection during climate change vary depending on how their trophic interactions become disrupted. Plant abundance can be controlled by aboveground and belowground multitrophic level interactions with herbivores, pathogens, symbionts and their enemies. We discuss how these interactions may alter during climate change and the resulting species range shifts. We suggest conceptual analogies between species responses to climate warming and exotic species introduced in new ranges. There are also important differences: the herbivores, pathogens and mutualistic symbionts of range-expanding species and their enemies may co-migrate, and the continuous gene flow under climate warming can make adaptation in the expansion zone of range expanders different from that of cross-continental exotic species. We conclude that under climate change, results of altered species interactions may vary, ranging from species becoming rare to disproportionately abundant. Taking these possibilities into account will provide a new perspective on predicting species distribution under climate change.},

  abstract = {In this paper we study the consequences of habitat switching and the corresponding ontogenetic diet shifts between adult and juvenile life stages for harvesting and management of exploited populations using a consumer-resource model with stage-specific mortality. Specifically, we study how differences in stage-specific habitat productivity regulate exploited populations and affect yield. We show that the ratio of adult to juvenile habitat productivity determines whether the population is regulated by processes in the juvenile or adult stage and that population responses to changes in mortality (e. g. fishing) or habitat productivity (e. g. eutrophication or physical destruction) depend critically on the mechanism regulating the population. This result has important consequences for the management of marine fish. For example, in fisheries where the exploited population is regulated by processes in the juvenile stage, management measures aimed at protecting the juvenile habitat may be much more effective than regulating fishing effort on the adults. We find also that intermediate differences in habitat productivity lead to alternative stable states between a population regulated by processes in the juvenile or the adult stage. These alternative stable states may lead to counterintuitive population responses to harvesting.},

  abstract = {Climate change studies have long focused on effects of increasing temperatures, often without considering other simultaneously occurring environmental changes, such as browning of waters. Resolving how the combination of warming and browning of aquatic ecosystems affects fish biomass production is essential for future ecosystem functioning, fisheries, and food security. In this study, we analyzed individual- and population-level fish data from 52 temperate and boreal lakes in Northern Europe, covering large gradients in water temperature and color (absorbance, 420 nm). We show that fish (Eurasian perch, Perca fluviatilis) biomass production decreased with both high water temperatures and brown water color, being lowest in warm and brown lakes. However, while both high temperature and brown water decreased fish biomass production, the mechanisms behind the decrease differed: temperature affected the fish biomass production mainly through a decrease in population standing stock biomass, and through shifts in size- and age-distributions toward a higher proportion of young and small individuals in warm lakes; brown water color, on the other hand, mainly influenced fish biomass production through negative effects on individual body growth and length-at-age. In addition to these findings, we observed that the effects of temperature and brown water color on individual-level processes varied over ontogeny. Body growth only responded positively to higher temperatures among young perch, and brown water color had a stronger negative effect on body growth of old than on young individuals. Thus, to better understand and predict future fish biomass production, it is necessary to integrate both individual- and population-level responses and to acknowledge within-species variation. Our results suggest that global climate change, leading to browner and warmer waters, may negatively affect fish biomass production, and this effect may be stronger than caused by increased temperature or water color alone.},

  abstract = {Current understanding of fish population responses to climate change is often limited to studies on the effect of temperature, ignoring potential co-occurring changes in other environmental variables. However, next to getting warmer, temperate and boreal aquatic systems are getting browner due to increased concentrations of dissolved organic carbon. Studies also generally predict mean population responses to climate change, thereby ignoring the potential for size, sex, and also species-specific responses. In this thesis, I aim to study the effects of warmer and browner waters on individual and population level responses in fish, and investigate if these responses vary with size, sex, and between species (Eurasian perch, Perca fluviatilis or common roach, Rutilus rutilus). To do this I used multiple methods, including space-for-time analyses, a wholeecosystem warming experiment, and aquaria and mesocosm experiments. I found that both warming and browning of lakes will likely decrease fish biomass production. Warming may cause a shift in size-structure towards smaller perch individuals and a lower perch population biomass, while browning will likely affect perch biomass production through lower body growth. Body growth responses to warming likely depend on body size, as small but not large individuals in my study were positively affected by high temperatures, and also sex, as males were more negatively affected by warming than females. Responses to browning may vary with body size and between species, as I found browning had a stronger negative effect on body growth of larger individuals in perch, while in roach browning only affected very small individuals. Overall, my findings suggest that future warming and browning will negatively affect fish individuals and populations, but that responses will vary with size, sex, and species, with potential consequences for ecological interactions and ecosystem functioning. This thesis highlights the importance of considering multiple climate stressors, integrating responses across several levels of biological organization, and acknowledging withinand between species variation, in order to understand and predict fish population responses to further climate change.},

  abstract = {Currently applied fisheries models and stock assessments rely on the assumption that density-dependent regulation only affects processes early in life, as described by stock\textendash recruitment relationships. However, many fish stocks also experience density-dependent processes late in life, such as density-dependent adult growth. Theoretical studies have found that, for stocks which experience strong late-in-life density dependence, maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is obtained with a small fishery size-at-entry that also targets juveniles. This goes against common fisheries advice, which dictates that primarily adults should be fished. This study aims to examine whether the strength of density-dependent growth in actual fish stocks is sufficiently strong to reduce optimal fishery size-at-entry to below size-at-maturity. A size-structured model is fitted to three stocks that have shown indications of late-in-life density-dependent growth: North Sea plaice (Pleuronectes platessa), Northeast Atlantic (NEA) mackerel (Scomber scombrus), and Baltic sprat (Sprattus sprattus balticus). For all stocks, the model predicts exploitation at MSY with a large size-at-entry into the fishery, indicating that late-in-life density dependence in fish stocks is generally not strong enough to warrant the targeting of juveniles. This result lends credibility to the practise of predominantly targeting adults in spite of the presence of late-in-life density-dependent growth.},

The increasing seal stocks cause notable damage to fisheries in the Baltic Sea, with an unknown number of seals drowning in fishing gear every year. Thus, sustainable seal management requires updated knowledge of the by-catch of seals\textendash the number of specimens that die in fishing gear. We analyse the by-catch of grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) in Finland, Sweden, and Estonia in 2012. We collect data with interviews (35 in Finland, 54 in Sweden, and 72 in Estonia) and analyse them with a hierarchical Bayesian model. The model accounts for variability in seal abundance, seal mortality and fishing effort in different sub-areas of the Baltic Sea and allows us to predict the by-catch in areas where interview data was not available. We provide a detailed description of the survey design and interview methods, and discuss different factors affecting fishermen's motivation to report by-catch and how this may affect the results. Our analysis shows that the total yearly by-catch by trap and gill nets in Finland, Sweden and Estonia is, with 90\% probability, more than 1240 but less than 2860; and the posterior median and mean of the total by-catch are 1550 and 1880 seals, respectively. Trap nets make about 88\% of the total by-catch. However, results also indicate that in one of the sub-areas of this study, fishermen may have underreported their by-catch. Taking the possible underreporting into account the posterior mean of the total by-catch is between 2180 and 2380. The by-catch in our study area is likely to represent at least 90\% of the total yearly grey seal by-catch in the Baltic Sea.},

When populations fail to recover after a collapse, this may indicate alternative stable states in the system. Overfishing has caused several of the most compelling cases of these dynamics, and in particular Atlantic cod stocks exemplify such lack of recovery. Often, competition between prey species and juvenile predators is hypothesized to explain the lack of recovery of predator populations. The predator is then considered to compete with its prey for one resource when small and to subsequently shift to piscivory. Yet predator life history is often more complex than that, including multiple ontogenetic diet shifts. Here we show that no alternative stable states occur when predators in an intermediate life stage feed on an additional resource (exclusive to the predator) before switching to piscivory, because predation and competition between prey and predator do not simultaneously structure community dynamics. We find top-down control by the predator only when there is no feedback from predator foraging on the additional resource. Otherwise, the predator population dynamics are governed by a bottleneck in individual growth occurring in the intermediate life stage. Therefore, additional resources for predators may be beneficial or detrimental for predator population growth and strongly influence the potential for top-down community control.},

This phenomenon, known as the temperature\textendash size rule, has important consequences for global fisheries, whereby ocean warming is predicted to result in smaller fish and reduced biomass. However, the generality of this phenomenon and the mechanisms that drive it in natural populations remain unresolved. In this study, we document the maximal size of 74 fish species along a steep temperature gradient in the Mediterranean Sea and find strong support for the temperature\textendash size rule. Importantly, we additionally find that size reduction in active fish species is dramatically larger than for more sedentary species. As the temperature dependence of oxygen consumption depends on activity levels, these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that oxygen is a limiting factor shaping the temperature\textendash size rule in fishes. These results suggest that ocean warming will result in a sharp, but uneven, reduction in fish size that will cause major shifts in size-dependent interactions. Moreover, warming will have major implications for fisheries as the main species targeted for harvesting will show the most substantial declines in biomass.},

Multiple factors associated with climate-driven deoxygenation contributed to blue shark vertical habitat compression, potentially increasing their vulnerability to surface fisheries. Greater intensity of longline fishing effort occurred above the OMZ compared to adjacent waters. Higher shark catches were associated with strong DO gradients, suggesting potential aggregation along suitable DO gradients contributed to habitat compression and higher fishing-induced mortality.

As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparison of predictive errors between two models. We implement the computations in an R package called loo and demonstrate using models fit with the Bayesian inference package Stan.},

As temperature directly affects physiological rates, it is clear that a mechanistic understanding of species vulnerability should be grounded in organismal physiology. Here, we review what respiratory physiology can offer the field of thermal ecology, showcasing different perspectives on how respiratory physiology can help explain thermal niches. In water, maintaining adequate oxygen delivery to fuel the higher metabolic rates under warming conditions can become the weakest link, setting thermal tolerance limits. This has repercussions for growth and scaling of metabolic rate. On land, water loss is more likely to become problematic as long as O2 delivery and pH balance can be maintained, potentially constraining species in their normal activity. Therefore, high temperatures need not be lethal, but can still affect the energy intake of an animal, with concomitant consequences for long-term fitness. While respiratory challenges and adaptive responses are diverse, there are clear recurring elements such as oxygen uptake, CO2 excretion, and water homeostasis. We show that respiratory physiology has much to offer the field of thermal ecology and call for an integrative, multivariate view incorporating respiratory challenges, thermal responses, and energetic consequences. Fruitful areas for future research are highlighted.},

  abstract = {Over the last decade, numerous studies have investigated the role of oxygen in setting thermal tolerance in aquatic animals, and there has been particular focus on arthropods. Arthropods comprise one of the most species-rich taxonomic groups on Earth, and display great diversity in the modes of ventilation, circulation, blood oxygen transport, with representatives living both in water (mainly crustaceans) and on land (mainly insects). The oxygen and capacity limitation of thermal tolerance (OCLTT) hypothesis proposes that the temperature dependent performance curve of animals is shaped by the capacity for oxygen delivery in relation to oxygen demand. If correct, oxygen limitation could provide a mechanistic framework to understand and predict both current and future impacts of rapidly changing climate. In arthropods, most studies testing the OCLTT hypothesis have considered tolerance to thermal extremes. These studies likely operate from the philosophical viewpoint that if the model can predict these critical thermal limits, then it is more likely to also explain loss of performance at less extreme, non-lethal temperatures, for which much less data is available. Nevertheless, the extent to which lethal temperatures are influenced by limitations in oxygen supply remains unresolved. Here we critically evaluate the support and universal applicability for oxygen limitation being involved in lethal temperatures in crustaceans and insects. The relatively few studies investigating the OCLTT hypothesis at low temperature do not support a universal role for oxygen in setting the lower thermal limits in arthropods. With respect to upper thermal limits, the evidence supporting OCLTT is stronger for species relying on underwater gas exchange, while the support for OCLTT in air-breathers is weak. Overall, strongest support was found for increased anaerobic metabolism close to thermal maxima. In contrast, there was only mixed support for the prediction that aerobic scope decreases near critical temperatures, a key feature of the OCLTT hypothesis. In air-breathers, only severe hypoxia (\textbackslash textless2kPa) affected heat tolerance. The discrepancies for heat tolerance between aquatic and terrestrial organisms can to some extent be reconciled by differences in the capacity to increase oxygen transport. As air-breathing arthropods are unlikely to become oxygen limited under normoxia (especially at rest), the oxygen limitation component in OCLTT does not seem to provide sufficient information to explain lethal temperatures. Nevertheless, many animals may simultaneously face hypoxia and thermal extremes and the combination of these potential stressors is particularly relevant for aquatic organisms where hypoxia (and hyperoxia) is more prevalent. In conclusion, whether taxa show oxygen limitation at thermal extremes may be contingent on their capacity to regulate oxygen uptake, which in turn is linked to their respiratory medium (air vs. water). Fruitful directions for future research include testing multiple predictions of OCLTT in the same species. Additionally, we call for greater research efforts towards studying the role of oxygen in thermal limitation of animal performance at less extreme, sub-lethal temperatures, necessitating studies over longer timescales and evaluating whether oxygen becomes limiting for animals to meet energetic demands associated with feeding, digestion and locomotion.},

However, the generality of this hypothesis has been challenged by studies on various animal groups, including air-breathing adult insects. Recently, comparisons across taxa have suggested that differences in gas exchange mechanisms could reconcile the discrepancies found in previous studies. Here, we test this suggestion by comparing the behaviour of related insect taxa with different gas exchange mechanisms, with and without access to air. We demonstrate oxygen-limited thermal tolerance in air-breathing adults of the plastron-exchanging water bug Aphelocheirus aestivalis. Ilyocoris cimicoides, a related, bimodal gas exchanger, did not exhibit such oxygen-limited thermal tolerance and relied increasingly on aerial gas exchange with warming. Intriguingly, however, when denied access to air, oxygen-limited thermal tolerance could also be induced in this species. Patterns in oxygen-limited thermal tolerance were found to be consistent across life-history stages in these insects, with nymphs employing the same gas exchange mechanisms as adults. These results advance our understanding of oxygen limitation at high temperatures; differences in the degree of respiratory control appear to modulate the importance of oxygen in setting tolerance limits.},

  abstract = {1. Organisms of gigantic proportions inhabited the world at a time of a hyperoxic prehistoric atmosphere (Palaeozoic gigantism). Extant giants are found in cold polar waters, with large quantities of dissolved oxygen (polar gigantism). Oxygen is usually deemed central to explain such gigantism. Examples of one category of gigantism are often cited in support of the other, but novel insights into the bioavailability of oxygen imply that they cannot be taken as equivalent manifestations of the effect of oxygen on body size. 2. Recently, the availability of oxygen has been shown to be lower in cold waters, despite greater oxygen solubility. Consequently, gigantism in cold, oxygenated waters and gigantism in an oxygen-pressurized world are fundamentally different: Palaeozoic gigantism likely arose because of greater oxygen availability, while polar gigantism arises in spite of lower oxygen availability. 3. The traditional view of respiration focuses on meeting the challenge of extracting sufficient amounts of oxygen, which essentially is a toxic gas. We present a broader perspective, which specifically includes risks of oxygen poisoning. We discuss how challenges pertaining to balancing oxygen uptake capacity and risks of oxygen poisoning are very different for animals breathing either air or water. 4. We propose a novel explanation for polar gigantism in aquatic ectotherms, arguing that their larger body size represents a respiratory advantage that helps to overcome the larger viscous forces in water. Being large helps organisms to balance the opposing risks of asphyxiation and poisoning, especially in colder, more viscous, water. This results in a selection for larger sizes, with polar gigantism as the extreme manifestation. Hence, a larger size provides respiratory benefits to water-breathing ectotherms, but not terrestrial ectotherms. This can explain why clines in body size across temperature and latitude are stronger in aquatic ectotherms.},

This is, however, a notoriously difficult task in estuarine ecosystems, where environmental gradients are steep, and where benthic biodiversity is highly variable in space and time. Although recent emphasis on diverse, healthy benthic communities in legislative frameworks has increased the number of indices developed for assessing benthic status, there is a lack of quantitative baselines in benthic diversity that would enable comparisons across broad spatial scales, encompassing different environmental settings and bioregions. By taking advantage of long-term monitoring data, spanning hundreds of stations over the past 40 years, we provide a comprehensive analysis of benthic {$\alpha$}, {$\beta$}, and {$\gamma$} diversity, encompassing the entire salinity gradient of the open sea areas of the large, brackish-water Baltic Sea. Using a relatively simple measure, average regional diversity, we define area-specific reference conditions and acceptable deviation against which to gauge current conditions in benthic macrofaunal diversity. Results show a severely impaired condition throughout large areas of the Baltic for the assessment period 2001\textendash 2006. All ecosystems are plagued by baselines that shift in time and space, and their definition is not trivial, but average regional diversity may offer a transparent way to deal with such changes in low-diversity systems. Identifying baselines will be of increasing importance given the potential of climatic drivers to interact with local anthropogenic stressors to affect patterns of biodiversity. Our analysis provides an evaluation of the current condition in a system that has been heavily influenced by anthropogenic impact and changing oceanographic conditions, and it provides a basis for future impact assessment and ecosystem-based management.},

However, the mechanisms that would underlie these predicted responses are not clear. Many studies have focused on proximate mechanisms of physiological processes affecting individual growth. One can also consider ultimate mechanisms involving adaptive explanations by evaluating temperature effects on different vital rates across the life history and using the information in a population dynamical model. Here, we combine long-term data for a top predator in freshwater ecosystems (pike; Esox lucius) with a stochastic integral projection model to analyze concurrent effects of temperature on vital rates, body size, and population dynamics. As predicted, the net effect of warming on population growth rate (fitness) is positive, but the thermal sensitivity of this rate is highly size- and vital rate-dependent. These results are not sensitive to increasing variability in temperature. Somatic growth follows the temperature-size rule, and our results support an adaptive explanation for this response. The stable length structure of the population shifts with warming toward an increased proportion of medium-sized but a reduced proportion of small and large individuals. This study highlights how demographic approaches can help reveal complex underlying mechanisms for population responses to warming.},

We used a three-dimensional, coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model to investigate potential future changes in size and location of potential habitats of marine species during the 21st century in a large, eutrophicated brackish sea (the Baltic Sea, northern Europe). We conducted scenario projections under the combined impact of nutrient load and climate change. Possible future changes of the eutrophication state of this sea were also assessed through two policy-relevant indicators. The results imply a physiologically more stressful environment for marine species by the end of the 21st century: volumes of higher salinity water become more hypoxic/anoxic and the volumes of low salinity, oxic water increase. For example, these results impact and reduce cod reproductive habitats. The decrease is mainly climate change induced in the Baltic basins less directly influenced by inflows of saline, oxic water to the Baltic Sea (E Gotland and Gdansk Basins). In basins more directly influenced by such inflows (Arkona and Bornholm Basins), the combined effect from climate change and nutrient loads is of importance. The results for the eutrophication state indicators clearly indicate a more eutrophic sea than at present without a rigorous nutrient reduction policy, that is, the necessity to implement the Baltic Sea Action Plan. The multidisciplinary, multiscenario assessment strategy presented here provides a useful concept for the evaluation of impacts from cumulative stresses of changing climate and socioeconomic pressures on future eutrophication indicators and habitats of marine species.},

We analysed the performance of 68 abundance-based species distribution models fitted to 800 000 standardised abundance records for more than 800 terrestrial bird and reef fish species. We found a large amount of variation in the performance of abundance-based models. While many models performed poorly, a subset of models consistently reconstructed range-wide abundance patterns. The best predictions were obtained using random forests for frequently encountered and abundant species and for predictions within the same environmental domain as model calibration. Extending predictions of species abundance outside of the environmental conditions used in model training generated poor predictions. Thus, interpolation of abundances between observations can help improve understanding of spatial abundance patterns, but our results indicate extrapolated predictions of abundance under changing climate have a much greater uncertainty. Our synthesis provides a road map for modelling abundance patterns, a key property of species distributions that underpins theoretical and applied questions in ecology and conservation.},

Also from this more complex perspective, recent case studies have emphasized evidence on the effects of climate change on biotic interactions and ecosystem services. This review highlights the 'knowns' but also 'unknowns' resulting from recent climate impact studies and reveals limitations of (linear) extrapolations from recent climate-induced responses of species to expected trends and magnitudes of future climate change. Hence, there is need not only to continue to focus on the impacts of climate change on the actors in ecological networks but also and more intensively to focus on the linkages between them, and to acknowledge that biotic interactions and feedback processes lead to highly complex, nonlinear and sometimes abrupt responses.},

A reduction in haematocrit from 42+/-2\% to 20+/-3\% (mean +/- s.e.m.) caused a significant but minor reduction in upper critical temperature, from 35.8+/-0.1 to 35.1+/-0.2 degrees C, with no correlation between individual values for haematocrit and upper thermal limit. Anaemia did not influence the rise in oxygen uptake between 25 and 33 degrees C, because the anaemic fish were able to compensate for reduced blood oxygen carrying capacity with a significant increase in cardiac output. Therefore, in sea bass the upper critical temperature, at which they lost equilibrium, was not determined by an inability of the cardio-respiratory system to meet the thermal acceleration of metabolic demands.},

With the dramatic increase recruitment of this population in the last decade, in particular concentrations of fish on the eastern portion of the Bank, there has been a precipitous decrease in somatic growth, raising concerns for managers and stakeholders. In this study, the effect of environmental factors and density-dependence on somatic growth of eastern Georges Bank haddock was studied using a 2-step Generalized Additive Model (GAM) regression approach. The biotic and abiotic factors examined in the regression analysis included haddock density, sampling location, local sea surface and bottom temperature, salinity and short time series of phytoplankton bloom statistics. The relative importance of each covariate in the best selected model was investigated using the nested GAMs. We found that density-dependence explained most of the variation in haddock growth, where the impact of temperature varied by season. Though of less model importance, annual winter salinity and phytoplankton bloom magnitude (lagged by one year) also contributed the growth model fits. These relationships have the immediate application of contextualizing the observed change in haddock growth, but may also inform various aspects of the stock assessment process.},

However, such climate-driven effects on life histories and population dynamics remain unassessed for most fishes. For 332 Indo-Pacific fishes, we show positive effects of temperature on body growth (but with decreasing asymptotic length), reproductive rates (including earlier age-at-maturation), and natural mortality for all species, with the effect strength varying among habitat-related species groups. Reef and demersal fishes are more sensitive to temperature changes than pelagic and bathydemersal fishes. Using a life table, we show that the combined changes of life histories upon increasing temperature tend to facilitate population growth for slow life-history populations, but reduce it for fast life-history ones. Within our data, lower proportions (25\textendash 30\%) of slow life-history fishes but greater proportions of fast life-history fishes (42\textendash 60\%) show declined population growth rates under 1\,\textdegree C warming. Together, these findings suggest prioritizing sustainable management for fast life-history species.},

  abstract = {Ecological processes are rarely directly observable, and inference often relies on estimating hidden or latent processes. State-space models have become widely used for this task because of their ability to simultaneously estimate the multiple sources of variation (natural variability and variance attributed to observation errors). For multivariate time series, a second aim is often dimension reduction, or estimating a number of latent processes that are smaller than the number of observed time series. Dynamic factor analysis (DFA) has been used for performing time-series dimension reduction, where latent processes are modelled as random walks. Whereas this may be suitable for some situations, random walks may be too flexible for other cases. Here, we introduce a new class of models, where latent processes are modelled as smooth functions (basis splines, penalized splines or Gaussian process models). We implement these models in our bayesdfa r package, which uses the rstan package for fitting. After evaluating model performance with simulated data, we apply conventional models and our smooth trend models to two long-term datasets from the west coast of the United States: (a) a 35-year dataset of pelagic juvenile rockfishes and (b) a 39-year dataset of fisheries catches. Our simulations demonstrate that models matching the underlying trend smoothness make better out-of-sample predictions, but this advantage diminishes with increasing levels of observation error. For both case studies, the best smooth trend models had higher predictive accuracy, and yielded more precise predictions, compared to the conventional approach. The smooth trend factor models introduced here offer a new approach for state-space dimension reduction of multivariate time series. These flexible Bayesian models may be particularly useful for data that are clumped in time, for data with high signal to noise ratios and generally for data where the underlying trend is assumed to be relatively smooth.},

  abstract = {Identifying spatiotemporal hotspots is important for understanding basic ecological processes, but is particularly important for species at risk. A number of terrestrial and aquatic species are indirectly affected by anthropogenic impacts, simply because they tend to be associated with species that are targeted for removals. Using newly developed statistical models that allow for the inclusion of time-varying spatial effects, we examine how the co-occurrence of a targeted and nontargeted species can be modeled as a function of environmental covariates (temperature, depth) and interannual variability. The nontarget species in our case study (eulachon) is listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, and is encountered by fisheries off the U.S. West Coast that target pink shrimp. Results from our spatiotemporal model indicated that eulachon bycatch risk decreases with depth and has a convex relationship with sea surface temperature. Additionally, we found that over the 2007\textendash 2012 period, there was support for an increase in eulachon density from both a fishery data set (+40\%) and a fishery-independent data set (+55\%). Eulachon bycatch has increased in recent years, but the agreement between these two data sets implies that increases in bycatch are not due to an increase in incidental targeting of eulachon by fishing vessels, but because of an increasing population size of eulachon. Based on our results, the application of spatiotemporal models to species that are of conservation concern appears promising in identifying the spatial distribution of environmental and anthropogenic risks to the population.},

  abstract = {The bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) undergoes several habitat shifts between the littoral and pelagic zones of small lakes during its life history. After hatching in the littoral zone, bluegill fry migrate to the pelagic zone to feed on zooplankton. In this study the fry then returned to the littoral zone in four different lakes at a relatively constant size of \textdegree 12.5 mm standard length. Several years are spent feeding in the littoral zone vegetation before the bluegill again shifts to feeding on zooplankton, first in the water column above littoral vegetation and subsequently in the true pelagic zone. This shift to feeding on zooplankton occurred at a specific body size within a lake, but the size ranged from 50 to 83 mm among five different lakes. The size at which the shift occurred was directly correlated with the density of the major predator of the bluegill in these lakes, the largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides). We demonstrate that the bluegill is faced with a growth (or feeding) rate\textemdash predation risk trade\textemdash off in making these habitat shifts. Analysis of stomach contents, the growth of small fish caged in the pelagic zone, and predictions of foraging rates in both habitats all indicate that the pelagic zone is the more profitable habitat for all size classes of the bluegill. Through a series of pond experiments we further show that risk of predation by largemouth bass was 40\textemdash 80 times as great for small bluegills in the open water as for those in the vegetation. We interpret the patterns of habitat use by the bluegill in terms of a model that explicitly weights the costs (predation) and benefits (growth) of making a size\textemdash specific habitat shift to the pelagic. Finally, we discussed evidence that the bluegill can facultatively respond to changes in feeding rates and predation risk, and the consequences of such ontogenetic habitat shifts to community dynamics.},

  abstract = {Bayesian data analysis is increasingly used in ecology, but prior specification remains focused on choosing non-informative priors (e.g., flat or vague priors). One barrier to choosing more informative priors is that priors must be specified on model parameters (e.g., intercepts, slopes, and sigmas), but prior knowledge often exists on the level of the response variable. This is particularly true for common models in ecology, like generalized linear mixed models that have a link function and potentially dozens of parameters, each of which needs a prior distribution. We suggest that this difficulty can be overcome by simulating from the prior predictive distribution and visualizing the results on the scale of the response variable. In doing so, some common choices for non-informative priors on parameters can easily be seen to produce biologically impossible values of response variables. Such implications of prior choices are difficult to foresee without visualization. We demonstrate a workflow for prior selection using simulation and visualization with two ecological examples (predator\textendash prey body sizes and spider responses to food competition). This approach is not new, but its adoption by ecologists will help to better incorporate prior information in ecological models, thereby maximizing one of the benefits of Bayesian data analysis.},

  abstract = {The global distribution of primary production and consumption by humans (fisheries) is well-documented, but we have no map linking the central ecological process of consumption within food webs to temperature and other ecological drivers. Using standardized assays that span 105\textdegree{} of latitude on four continents, we show that rates of bait consumption by generalist predators in shallow marine ecosystems are tightly linked to both temperature and the composition of consumer assemblages. Unexpectedly, rates of consumption peaked at midlatitudes (25 to 35\textdegree ) in both Northern and Southern Hemispheres across both seagrass and unvegetated sediment habitats. This pattern contrasts with terrestrial systems, where biotic interactions reportedly weaken away from the equator, but it parallels an emerging pattern of a subtropical peak in marine biodiversity. The higher consumption at midlatitudes was closely related to the type of consumers present, which explained rates of consumption better than consumer density, biomass, species diversity, or habitat. Indeed, the apparent effect of temperature on consumption was mostly driven by temperature-associated turnover in consumer community composition. Our findings reinforce the key influence of climate warming on altered species composition and highlight its implications for the functioning of Earth's ecosystems.},

We develop a novel statistical framework enabling identification and classification of time series with similar temporal properties, and use this framework to systematically explore variation in population dynamics and seasonality in anopheline mosquito time series catch data spanning seven species, 40 years and 117 locations across mainland India. Our analyses reveal pronounced variation in dynamics across locations and between species in the extent of seasonality and timing of seasonal peaks. However, we show that these diverse dynamics can be clustered into four `dynamical archetypes', each characterized by distinct temporal properties and associated with a largely unique set of environmental factors. Our results highlight that a range of environmental factors including rainfall, temperature, proximity to static water bodies and patterns of land use (particularly urbanicity) shape the dynamics and seasonality of mosquito populations, and provide a generically applicable framework to better identify and understand patterns of seasonal variation in vectors relevant to public health.},

However, an examination of papers published in 2004 by three leading ecological and behavioural journals suggested that the use of this technique remains widespread: of 65 papers in which a multiple regression approach was used, 57\% of studies used a stepwise procedure. 2 The principal drawbacks of stepwise multiple regression include bias in parameter estimation, inconsistencies among model selection algorithms, an inherent (but often overlooked) problem of multiple hypothesis testing, and an inappropriate focus or reliance on a single best model. We discuss each of these issues with examples. 3 We use a worked example of data on yellowhammer distribution collected over 4 years to highlight the pitfalls of stepwise regression. We show that stepwise regression allows models containing significant predictors to be obtained from each year's data. In spite of the significance of the selected models, they vary substantially between years and suggest patterns that are at odds with those determined by analysing the full, 4-year data set. 4 An information theoretic (IT) analysis of the yellowhammer data set illustrates why the varying outcomes of stepwise analyses arise. In particular, the IT approach identifies large numbers of competing models that could describe the data equally well, showing that no one model should be relied upon for inference.},

  abstract = {In many fisheries multiple species are simultaneously caught while stock assessments and fishing quota are defined at species level. Yet species caught together often share habitat and resources, resulting in interspecific resource competition. The consequences of resource competition on population dynamics and revenue of simultaneously harvested species has received little attention due to the historical single stock approach in fisheries management. Here we present the results of a modelling study on the interaction between resource competition of sole (Solea solea) and slaice (Pleuronectus platessa) and simultaneous harvesting of these species, using a stage-structured population model. Three resources were included of which one is shared with a varied competition intensity. We find that plaice is the better competitor of the two species and adult plaice are more abundant than adult sole. When competition is high sole population biomass increases with increasing fishing effort prior to plaice extinction. As a result of this increase in the sole population, the revenue of the stocks combined as function of effort becomes bimodal with increasing resource competition. When considering a single stock quota for sole, its recovery with increasing effort may result in even more fishing effort that would drive the plaice population to extinction. When sole and plaice compete for resources the highest revenue is obtained at effort levels at which plaice is extinct. Ignoring resource competition promotes overfishing due to increasing stock of one species prior to extinction of the other species. Consequently, efforts to mitigate the decline in one species will not be effective if increased stock in the other species leads to increased quota. If a species is to be protected against extinction, management should not only be directed at this one species, but all species that compete with it for resource as well.},

  abstract = {It is widely believed that predation moderates interspecific competition and promotes prey diversity. Still, in models of two prey sharing a resource and a predator, predator-mediated coexistence occurs only over narrow ranges of resource productivity. These models have so far ignored the widespread feature of ontogenetic diet shifts in predators. Here, we theoretically explore the consequences of a diet shift from juvenile to adult predator stages for coexistence of two competing prey. We find that only very minor deviations from perfectly identical diets in juveniles and adults destroy the ``traditional'' mechanism of predatormediated coexistence, which requires an intrinsic trade-off between prey defendedness and competitive ability. Instead, predator population structure can create an ``emergent'' competition\textendash predation trade-off between prey, where a bottleneck in one predator stage enhances predation on the superior competitor and relaxes predation on the inferior competitor, irrespective of the latter's intrinsic defendedness. Pronounced diet shifts therefore greatly enlarge the range of prey coexistence along a resource gradient. With diet shifts, however, coexistence usually occurs as one of two alternative states and, once lost, may not be easily restored.},

To predict their ecosystem-wide consequences we must understand how these impacts propagate. A long-standing, but so far elusive, problem in this endeavour is how to reduce food web complexity to a mathematically tractable, but empirically relevant system. Simplification to main energy channels linking primary producers to top consumers has been recently advocated. Following this approach, we propose a general framework for the analysis of bottom-up and top-down forcing of ecosystems by reducing food webs to two energy pathways originating from a limiting resource shared by competing guilds of primary producers (e.g. edible vs. defended plants). Exploring dynamical models of such webs we find that their equilibrium responses to nutrient enrichment and top consumer harvesting are determined by only two easily measurable topological properties: the lengths of the component food chains (odd\textendash odd, odd\textendash even, or even\textendash even) and presence vs. absence of a generalist top consumer reconnecting the two pathways (yielding looped vs. branched webs). Many results generalise to other looped or branched web structures and the model can be easily adapted to include a detrital pathway.},

For aquatic organisms, the consequences are poorly known but are likely to reflect both direct effects of declining oxygen bioavailability and interactions between oxygen and other stressors, including two\textemdash warming and acidification\textemdash that have received substantial attention in recent decades and that typically accompany oxygen changes. Drawing on the collected papers in this symposium volume (``An Oxygen Perspective on Climate Change''), we outline the causes and consequences of declining oxygen bioavailability. First, we discuss the scope of natural and predicted anthropogenic changes in aquatic oxygen levels. Although modern organisms are the result of long evolutionary histories during which they were exposed to natural oxygen regimes, anthropogenic change is now exposing them to more extreme conditions and novel combinations of low oxygen with other stressors. Second, we identify behavioral and physiological mechanisms that underlie the interactive effects of oxygen with other stressors, and we assess the range of potential organismal responses to oxygen limitation that occur across levels of biological organization and over multiple timescales. We argue that metabolism and energetics provide a powerful and unifying framework for understanding organism-oxygen interactions. Third, we conclude by outlining a set of approaches for maximizing the effectiveness of future work, including focusing on long-term experiments using biologically realistic variation in experimental factors and taking truly cross-disciplinary and integrative approaches to understanding and predicting future effects.},

The size-based food web model includes linkages between two size-structured pelagic communities: primary producers and consumers. Our investigation focuses on seven sites in the North Pacific, each highlighting a specific aspect of projected climate change, and includes top-down ecosystem depletion through fishing. We project declines in large fish abundance ranging from 0 to 75.8\% in the central North Pacific and increases of up to 43.0\% in the California Current (CC) region over the 21st century in response to change in phytoplankton size structure and direct physiological effects. We find that fish abundance is especially sensitive to projected changes in large phytoplankton density and our model projects changes in the abundance of large fish being of the same order of magnitude as changes in the abundance of large phytoplankton. Thus, studies that address only climate-induced impacts to primary production without including changes to phytoplankton size structure may not adequately project ecosystem responses.},

We find that when fishing and climate change are examined individually, fishing is the greater stressor. This suggests that proactive fisheries management could be a particularly effective tool for mitigating anthropogenic stressors either by balancing or outweighing climate effects. However, modeling these stressors jointly shows that even large management changes cannot completely offset climate effects. Our results suggest that a decline in Hawaii's longline fishery yield may be inevitable. The effect of climate change on the ecosystem depends primarily upon the intensity of fishing mortality. Management measures which take this into account can both minimize fishery decline and support at least some level of ecosystem resilience.},

For example, based on the same climate forcing the species-based model projects a 15\% decline in catch by the end of the century while the size-based model projects a 30\% decline. Disparities in the models' output highlight the limitations of each approach by showing the influence model structure can have on model output. The aspects of bottom-up change to which each model is most sensitive appear linked to model structure, as does the propagation of interannual variability through the food web and the relative impact of combined top-down and bottomup change. Incorporating integrated size- and species-based ecosystem modeling approaches into future ensemble studies may help separate the influence of model structure from robust projections of ecosystem change.},

  abstract = {The size and age at which individuals mature is rapidly changing due to plastic and evolved responses to fisheries harvest and global warming. Understanding the nature of these changes is essential because maturity schedules are critical in determining population demography and ultimately, the economic value and viability of fisheries. Detecting maturity changes is, however, practically difficult and costly. A recently proposed biphasic growth modelling likelihood profiling method offers great potential as it can statistically estimate age-at-maturity from population-level size-at-age data, using the change-point in growth that occurs at maturity. Yet, the performance of the method on typical marine fisheries datasets remains untested. Here, we assessed the suitability of 12 North Sea and Australian species' datasets for the likelihood profiling approach. The majority of the fisheries datasets were unsuitable as they had too small sample sizes or too large size-at-age variation. Further, datasets that did satisfy data requirements generally showed no correlation between empirical and model-derived maturity estimates. To understand why the biphasic approach had low performance we explored its sensitivity using simulated datasets. We found that method performance for marine fisheries datasets is likely to be low because of: (1) truncated age structures due to intensive fishing, (2) an under-representation of young individuals in datasets due to common fisheries-sampling protocols, and (3) large intrapopulation variability in growth curves. To improve our ability to detect maturation changes from population level size-at-age data we need to improve data collection protocols for fisheries monitoring.},

  abstract = {Global warming and fisheries harvest are significantly impacting wild fish stocks, yet their interactive influence on population resilience to stress remains unclear. We explored these interactive effects on early-life development and survival by experimentally manipulating the thermal and harvest regimes in 18 zebrafish (Danio rerio) populations over six consecutive generations. Warming advanced development rates across generations, but after three generations, it caused a sudden and large (30\textendash 50\%) decline in recruitment. This warming impact was most severe in populations where size-selective harvesting reduced the average size of spawners. We then explored whether our observed recruitment decline could be explained by changes in egg size, early egg and larval survival, population sex ratio, and developmental costs. We found that it was most likely driven by temperature-induced shifts in embryonic development rate and fishing-induced male-biased sex ratios. Importantly, once harvest and warming were relaxed, recruitment rates rapidly recovered. Our study suggests that the effects of warming and fishing could have strong impacts on wild stock recruitment, but this may take several generations to manifest. However, resilience of wild populations may be higher if fishing preserves sufficient body size diversity, and windows of suitable temperature periodically occur.},

Known as the temperature-size rule (TSR), this pattern is commonly attributed to higher metabolism in warmer waters, leaving fewer resources for growth. An alternative explanation focuses on growth and reproduction trade-offs across temperatures. We tested these hypotheses by measuring growth, maturation, metabolism and reproductive allocation from zebrafish populations kept at 26 and 30\textdegree C across six generations. Zebrafish growth and maturation followed TSR expectations but were not explained by baseline metabolic rate, which converged between temperature treatments after a few generations. Rather, we found that females at 30\textdegree C allocated more to reproduction, especially when maturing at the smallest sizes. We show that elevated temperatures do not necessarily increase baseline metabolism if sufficient acclimation is allowed and call for an urgent revision of modelling assumptions used to predict population and ecosystem responses to warming.},

In this study, we aimed to identify which freshwater fishes are most sensitive to climatic changes and asked: (i) how fast are lakes warming? (ii) how fast are fishes moving? and (iii) are freshwater fishes tracking climate? Location Ontario, Canada. Methods We assembled a database containing time series data on climate and species occurrence data from 10,732 lakes between 1986 and 2017. We calculated the rate of lake warming and climate velocity for these lakes. Climate velocities were compared with biotic velocities, specifically the rate at which the northernmost extent of each species shifted north. Results Lakes in Ontario warmed by 0.2\textdegree C decade-1 on average, at a climate velocity of 9.4 km decade-1 between 1986 and 2017. In response, some freshwater fishes have shifted their northern range boundaries with considerable interspecific variation ranging from species moving southwards at a rate of -58.9 km decade-1 to species ranges moving northwards at a rate of 83.6 km decade-1 over the same time period. More freshwater fish species are moving into northern lakes in Ontario than those being lost. Generally, predators are moving their range edges northwards, whereas prey fishes are being lost from northern lakes. Main Conclusions The concurrent loss of cooler refugia, combined with antagonistic competitive and predatory interactions with the range expanding species, has resulted in many commercially important predators moving their range edges northwards, whereas prey species have contracted their northern range edge boundaries. Trophic partitioning of range shifts highlights a previously undocumented observation of the loss of freshwater fishes from lower trophic levels in response to climate-driven migrations.},

  abstract = {Effects of temperature on growth, feeding rate and feed conversion ratio (FCR) of juvenile Pacific white shrimp, Penaeus vannamei (Boone), were quantified in a series of four experiments. In each of experiments 1 to 3, a single size class of shrimp was reared at three constant temperatures (23, 27, 30 \textdegree C) and at an ambient temperature control (mean 26.2 \textdegree C). In the three experiments, mean shrimp stocking sizes were 3.9, 10.8 and 16.0 g, respectively. Shrimp growth and feeding rate increased directly with temperature in each experiment, but the increases varied among the three size classes so that thermal effects on growth and feeding were size-specific. FCR of small shrimp was not different among the three test temperatures while FCR of medium-and large-sized shrimp varied with temperature. Differences in growth response among size classes was the basis for a fourth experiment, in which two size classes were grown at three temperatures. Growth and feeding rate were again directly related to temperature and varied inversely with size. FCR was primarily related to size; larger shrimp grew less efficiently. Large temperature coefficients, particularly between 23 and 27 \textdegree C, demonstrate that P. vannamei growth is extremely sensitive to small changes in temperature. These data also indicate that temperature optima (temperature of fastest growth) is size-specific and decreases as shrimp size increases. For small shrimp ({$<$} 5 g), temperature optima may be greater than 30 \textdegree C while for large shrimp, the temperature optimum is about 27 \textdegree C. These findings appear consistent with the distribution of P. vannamei during its natural life history. For P. vannamei farmers, these data indicate that for all sizes reduced growth and feeding can be expected when pond temperature is below 23 \textdegree C and for large shrimp when pond temperature is 30 \textdegree C or greater.},

For example, model parameters assumed to be fixed constants may actually vary in time, models may fit well to existing data but lack out-of-sample predictive skill, and key driving variables may be misidentified due to transient (mirage) correlations that are common in nonlinear systems. With these frailties, it is somewhat surprising that static equilibrium models continue to be widely used. Here, we examine empirical dynamic modeling (EDM) as an alternative to imposed model equations and that accommodates both nonequilibrium dynamics and nonlinearity. Using time series from nine stocks of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) from the Fraser River system in British Columbia, Canada, we perform, for the the first time to our knowledge, real-data comparison of contemporary fisheries models with equivalent EDM formulations that explicitly use spawning stock and environmental variables to forecast recruitment. We find that EDM models produce more accurate and precise forecasts, and unlike extensions of the classic Ricker spawner-recruit equation, they show significant improvements when environmental factors are included. Our analysis demonstrates the strategic utility of EDM for incorporating environmental influences into fisheries forecasts and, more generally, for providing insight into how environmental factors can operate in forecast models, thus paving the way for equation-free mechanistic forecasting to be applied in management contexts.},

Juveniles of {$\leq$}20cm and adults of {$\geq$}30cm total length were collected from bottom trawl catch samples at stations located 10 to 120km from the Alaska Peninsula coast, and in bottom depths of 28 to 85m. Stomach contents and stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen from muscle tissue were analyzed to describe diet composition. The quantity and quality of prey did not significantly affect the distribution of juvenile NRS and YFS. Spatial mismatch between the diet composition and the infauna prey assemblage suggested that prey availability was not limiting across the area, allowing fish to select for prey, presumably to maximize net energy gain. The body condition of juvenile NRS was higher in the eastern section of the area (Bristol Bay) \textendash{} where they shared spatial and dietary niches with juvenile YFS, than in the west section (Unimak Island) where juvenile YFS were largely absent. A difference in body condition suggests that habitat quality may be higher in Bristol Bay. For NRS, stomach contents and stable isotopes in muscle tissue indicated an ontogenetic diet shift from amphipods to polychaetes from juvenile to adult stages. In contrast, for YFS, amphipods seemed to remain the primary prey and polychaetes the least important prey from juvenile to adult stage. Given that the high prey availability found in this south coastal area of EBS extends to areas across the EBS shelf, favorable habitat for juvenile flatfishes should be extensive. However, much of this potential juvenile habitat is underutilized by NRS, which were mainly limited to Bristol Bay and the Alaska Peninsula, whereas YFS did extend north over 500km from Bristol Bay along the inner shelf domain ({$\leq$}50m deep). Abiotic factors, particularly ocean currents and water temperature, may be more significant than prey availability in the spatial distribution of juveniles. Thus, changes in the hydrographic and thermal regime of the EBS are likely to impact juvenile flatfish distribution and habitat productivity.},

However, considerable uncertainties remain concerning potential feedback between the biota and the climate. In particular, it is unclear how global warming will affect the metabolic balance between the photosynthetic fixation and respiratory release of CO(2) at the ecosystem scale. Here, we present a combination of experimental field data from freshwater mesocosms, and theoretical predictions derived from the metabolic theory of ecology to investigate whether warming will alter the capacity of ecosystems to absorb CO(2). Our manipulative experiment simulated the temperature increases predicted for the end of the century and revealed that ecosystem respiration increased at a faster rate than primary production, reducing carbon sequestration by 13 per cent. These results confirmed our theoretical predictions based on the differential activation energies of these two processes. Using only the activation energies for whole ecosystem photosynthesis and respiration we provide a theoretical prediction that accurately quantified the precise magnitude of the reduction in carbon sequestration observed experimentally. We suggest the combination of whole-ecosystem manipulative experiments and ecological theory is one of the most promising and fruitful research areas to predict the impacts of climate change on key ecosystem services.},

Warming increased the steepness of the community size spectrum by increasing the prevalence of small organisms, primarily within the phytoplankton assemblage and it also reduced the mean and maximum size of phytoplankton by approximately one order of magnitude. The observed shifts in phytoplankton size structure were reflected in changes in phytoplankton community composition, though zooplankton taxonomic composition was unaffected by warming. Furthermore, warming reduced community biomass and total phytoplankton biomass, although zooplankton biomass was unaffected. This resulted in an increase in the zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass ratio in the warmed mesocosms, which could be explained by faster turnover within the phytoplankton assemblages. Overall, warming shifted the distribution of phytoplankton size towards smaller individuals with rapid turnover and low standing biomass, resulting in a reorganization of the biomass structure of the food webs. These results indicate future environmental warming may have profound effects on the structure and functioning of aquatic communities and ecosystems.},

(2013) Each life stage matters: the importance of assessing response to climate change over the complete life cycle in butterflies. Journal of Animal Ecology, 82, 275-285. Population-level responses to climate change depend on many factors, including unexpected interactions among life history attributes; however, few studies examine climate change impacts over complete life cycles of focal species. Radchuk, Turlure \& Schtickzelle () used experimental and modelling approaches to predict population dynamics for the bog fritillary butterfly under warming scenarios. Although they found that warming improved fertility and survival of all stages with one exception, populations were predicted to decline because overwintering larvae, whose survival declined with warming, were disproportionately important contributors to population growth. This underscores the importance of considering all life history stages in analyses of climate change's effects on population dynamics.},

This study explores the interaction of water temperature and body weight on both energy utilization strategy and energy conversion efficiency to promote further healthy culture of yellow catfish. Fish with body weights of 6 g (Group S), 16 g (Group M) and 35 g (Group B) were reared in 15 circular glass steel cylinders 80 cm in diameter \texttimes{} 70 cm in height (180 L) at water temperatures of 21, 24, 27, 30 and 33\textdegree C (3 replicates for each temperature) for 42 days to investigate effects of water temperature and body weight on the feeding, growth, digestion and energy budget in yellow catfish. Results showed that the levels of dry matter, protein and energy in the body were significantly affected by water temperature (p {$<$} .05). Feeding, growth, feed conversion efficiency, digestion and energy allocation parameters were significantly related to both water temperature and body weight (p {$<$} .05). Yellow catfish had higher maximal food consumption (Cmax), food intake rate, specific growth rate, food conversion efficiency, appear digestibility coefficient, and growth energy allocation (G) at 24\textendash 30\textdegree C, and optimal growth at a water temperature of 27\textdegree C. Two-\-factor analysis of variance revealed that there was reciprocation of both water temperature and body weight on the above parameters. At the optimal temperature of 27\textdegree C, the value of energy for growth (G) was the highest, and the value of energy for feces (F) produced was the lowest. Yellow catfish with various body weights had energy budget equations of 100 A = 63.70 R + 36.30 G in Group S, 100 A = 62.54 R + 37.46 G in Group M, and 100 A = 67.47 R + 32.53 G in Group B if the equations were described as percentage of the proportion of the assimilation energy. Therefore, the optimal temperature was 27\textdegree C according to its feeding, growth and digestion.},

  abstract = {Climate change affects ecological communities through its impact on the physiological performance of individuals. However, the population dynamic of species well inside their thermal niche is also determined by competitors, prey and predators, in addition to being influenced by temperature changes. We use a trait-based food-web model to examine how the interplay between the direct physiological effects from temperature and the indirect effects due to changing interactions between populations shapes the ecological consequences of climate change for populations and for entire communities. Our simulations illustrate how isolated communities deteriorate as populations go extinct when the environment moves outside the species' thermal niches. High-trophic-level species are most vulnerable, while the ecosystem function of lower trophic levels is less impacted. Open communities can compensate for the loss of ecosystem function by invasions of new species. Individual populations show complex responses largely uncorrelated with the direct impact of temperature change on physiology. Such complex responses are particularly evident during extinction and invasion events of other species, where climatically well-adapted species may be brought to extinction by the changed food-web topology. Our results highlight that the impact of climate change on specific populations is largely unpredictable, and apparently well-adapted species may be severely impacted.}

  abstract = {Climate change can affect fish individuals or schools, and consequently the fisheries. Studying future changes of fish distribution and abundance helps the scientific management of fisheries. The dynamic bioclimate envelope model (DBEM) was used to identify the ``environmental preference profiles'' of the studied species based on outputs from three Earth system models (ESMs). Changes in ocean conditions in climate change scenarios could be transformed by the model into those in relative abundance and distribution of species. Therefore, the distributional response of 17 demersal fishes to climate change in the Yellow Sea could be projected from 1970 to 2060. Indices of latitudinal centroid (LC) and mean temperature of relative abundance (MTRA) were used to represent the results conducted by model. Results present that 17 demersal fish species in the Yellow Sea show a trend of anti-poleward shift under both low-emission scenario (RCP 2.6) and high-emission scenario (RCP 8.5) from 1970 to 2060, with the projected average LC in three ESMs shifting at a rate of -1.17{$\pm$}4.55 and -2.76{$\pm$}3.82 km/decade, respectively, which is contrary to the previous projecting studies of fishes suggesting that fishes tend to move toward higher latitudes under increased temperature scenarios. The Yellow Sea Cold Water Mass could be the major driver resulting in the shift, which shows a potential significance to fishery resources management and marine conservation, and provides a new perspective in fish migration under climate change.},

  abstract = {Abstract Population regulation is a central concept in ecology, yet in many cases its presence and the underlying mechanisms are difficult to demonstrate. The current paradigm maintains that marine fish populations are predominantly regulated by density?dependent recruitment. While it is known that density?dependent somatic growth can be present too, its general importance remains unknown and most practical applications neglect it. This study aimed to close this gap by for the first time quantifying and comparing density dependence in growth and recruitment over a large set of fish populations. We fitted density?dependent models to time?series data on population size, recruitment and age?specific weight from commercially exploited fish populations in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean and the Baltic Sea. Data were standardized to enable a direct comparison within and among populations, and estimated parameters were used to quantify the impact of density regulation on population biomass. Statistically significant density dependence in recruitment was detected in a large proportion of populations (70\%), whereas for density dependence in somatic growth the prevalence of density dependence depended heavily on the method (26\% and 69\%). Despite age?dependent variability, the density dependence in recruitment was consistently stronger among age groups and between alternative approaches that use weight?at?age or weight increments to assess growth. Estimates of density?dependent reduction in biomass underlined these results: 97\% of populations with statistically significant parameters for growth and recruitment showed a larger impact of density?dependent recruitment on population biomass. The results reaffirm the importance of density?dependent recruitment in marine fishes, yet they also show that density dependence in somatic growth is not uncommon. Furthermore, the results are important from an applied perspective because density dependence in somatic growth affects productivity and catch composition, and therefore the benefits of maintaining fish populations at specific densities.},
